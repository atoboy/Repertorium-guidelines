               <p>These Guidelines are the first full introduction to the Repertorium Initiative XML model for the electronic description of Medieval manuscripts. The model is part of the activities of the Special Commission for Computer Processing of Medieval Slavonic Manuscripts and Early Printed Books to the Executive Board of the International Committee of Slavists. This version of the Guidelines differs significantly from all previous versions in both form and content. The most important new feature is the synchronization with the "P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange" of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (<ref target="#TEI">TEI</ref>) XML model. There do remain differences between the TEI and the Repertorium manuscript description models, but we have made every effort to bring two as close as possible, taking into consideration primarily the three principal Medieval manuscript traditions in Europe – Slavic, Greek, and Latin. We hope that the result will contribute to the general discussion on how to encode a manuscript description in electronic form. A special Appendix at the end of this text explains and discusses remaining differences between the TEI and Repertorium schemas and guidelines.</p>
               <p>This edition has been rewritten completely, and is not based directly on earlier attempts to document the Repertorium XML model. It contains many editorial changes, new examples, revised lists of elements and attributes, and discussions about a wide variety of topics.</p>
               <p>Previous versions of these Guidelines circulated only in electronic form. The first was compiled for the Annual TEI Members’ Meeting in 2005 in Sofia. Subsequently, within the framework of  the project „Slovo: Toward a Digital Library of South Slavic Manuscripts" (2007-2008, cf. <ref target="#Miklas2008">Miklas &amp; Miltenova 2008</ref>), funded by the Austrian Science and Liaison Offices, a new electronic version was prepared. Both are now archived and available on request. The present, new Guidelines are based on the ideas and proposals contained in various project papers, proceedings and special volumes (<ref target="#Birnbaum2000">Birnbaum &amp; Miltenova 2000</ref>, esp. Miltenova &amp; Bojadžiev 2000, Bojadžiev 2000, <ref target="#Dobreva2000">Dobreva 2000</ref>,                  <ref target="#Stojkova2000">Stojkova 2000</ref>,                  <ref target="#Radoslavova2000">Radoslavova 2000</ref>;                  <ref target="#Miltenova2003">Miltenova et al. 2003</ref>, esp. Cleminson 2003, Bojadžiev et al. 2003, Mussakova 2003, Krushelnitskaya 2003; Miklas &amp; Miltenova 2008, cf. Birnbaum et. al. 15; Cleminson 18; Gagova 18, 2000; Radoslavova 18; Stoykova 18), as well as in the Commission’s journal Scripta &amp; e-Scripta (e.g., Miltenova 2008; <ref target="#Bojadžiev2009">Boyadzhiev 2009</ref>). These ideas have also been presented and discussed at several conferences and workshops. It goes without saying that this published document can reflect only the current level of our work and the model may undergo further change, but we consider the present version representative of a stable stage in the development of the Repertorium schema that has been used effectively in production.</p>

               <head>About this document</head>
               <p>This document is provided as an introduction to the XML model for the description of Medieval Manuscripts known as the <emph>Repertorium Initiative</emph> or <emph>Template for 
              Slavic Manuscripts</emph> (TSM). It is intended for those who have some previous knowledge
              of XML technologies and who would like to describe Medieval manuscripts. It
              should not be considered a general introduction to markup technologies, nor a tutorial
              on the TEI approach to linguistic and literary markup. For the latter, see the fifth chapter of the current P5 edition of the TEI Guidelines (<ref target="#TEI_Gentle">TEI: V. A Gentle Introduction to XML</ref>).

         <div>
            <head>Short History</head>
            <p>The Repertorium Initiative started during 1994-1995 as „Computer-Supported
                  Processing of Medieval Slavic Manuscripts", an international project with coordinators Prof. David J. Birnbaum, University of Pittsburgh, USA and Dr. Anisava Miltenova (Institute of Literature, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences). The project was supported by the International Research &amp; Exchanges Board (<ref target="https://www.irex.org/">IREX</ref>), Washington, DC.
                  During this period an initial SGML model was developed by David J. Birnbaum,
                  Anisava Miltenova, Milena Dobreva (Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, BAS,
                  Bulgaria), Berend Dijk, and Harry Gaylord (both from the University of Groningen,
                  the Netherlands). Further work on defining content models, especially for textological, linguistic and palaeographical features, was implemented in 15 by David J.
                  Birnbaum, Anisava Miltenova and Andrej Bojadžiev.</p>
            <p>During the next three years (1996-1998) the project continued as a joint initiative under the guidance of Prof. Ralph Cleminson (Central European University
                  - Budapest, Hungary and the University of Portsmouth, Great Britain) and Dr. Anisava Miltenova, with the name „Computer Supported Processing of Medieval Slavic
                  Manuscripts and Early Printed Books", a joint project supported by Central European
                  University. At this time more than one hundred manuscript descriptions were encoded electronically and the project gained in popularity among scholars.</p>
            <p>At the Twelfth International Congress of Slavists in 1998 in Kraków the need for
                     markup technologies and standards and the lack of unified and well-established terminology in the field of Slavic Medieval Studies became obvious, and a new „<ref target="https://www.obshtezhitie.net/">Commission for the Computer Processing of Medieval Slavonic Manuscripts and Early
                  Printed Books</ref>" was chartered by the Executive Board of the International Committee
                  of Slavists (<ref target="#Miltenova1998">Miltenova et al. 1998</ref>). Members of the Commission are scholars from
                  more than twelve countries and the main function of the Commission is to serve as a
                  coordinator among various projects in the field.</p>
            <p>In 1999-2000 the SGML model was transferred to XML syntax by David J. Birnbaum. The team decided then to change not only the markup language, but also the declarations of some elements and attributes, both to improve the overall structure and
                     to enhance the functionality of the schema. This stage of development was completed
                     in 2001-2002. Since then the minor changes and improvements that have been made
                     to the model are, in most cases, backwards compatible. An experimental <emph>Repertorium
                        Workstation database</emph> was build upon the <ref target="https://exist-db.org/">Exist Native XML database</ref> by David J. Birnbaum (<ref target="#Birnbaum2009">Birnbaum 2009</ref>). It uses SVG technology to represent textological differences and similarities graphically.
            </p>
            <p>This model was presented at conferences in Bulgaria, Poland, Greece, the Netherlands, France, and the USA. Additionally, participants in the Repertorium project
                  conducted courses, lectures, and workshops about the Repertorium in Bulgaria, Sweden, Hungary, Germany, the USA, Serbia, and Russia.
            </p>
            <div>
               <head>Sources for the XML model</head>
               <p>The Repertorium model relies fully on structured markup technologies. The first
                     variant was compiled in 1994-1995 as an SGML Document Type Definition (ISO
                     8859:1987), based on TEI P3. The model presented here is based on Extensible
                     Markup Language (XML), a simplified and web-oriented variant of SGML, and specifically on the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI) P5 schemas. The Repertorium model reflects fifteen years of electronic philological descriptions of more than
                     three hundred Slavic Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts.
               </p>
               <p>From the beginning, the Manuscript Description Model, also called the Template for Slavic Manuscripts (TSM), has been related closely to the ideas of the Text
                     Encoding Initiative and the schema fragments used there (TEI). The current Repertorium Initiative XML model for manuscript description is build on top of TEI P5. For
                     the publication of Repertorium descriptions in electronic form, the project relies on
                     XSLT scripts that transform the input XML to XML, XHTML, and SVG.

               <head>Text Encoding Initiative Consortium and Repertorium</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative uses the TEI models as a principal framework for
                     encoding and interchange. However, the Repertorium model extends some of the TEI
                     element and attribute definitions, thus providing opportunities for the encoder to describe fully specific features of Medieval Slavonic texts. Simultaneously with our
                     work, the TEI Consortium published its own model for manuscript description, which
                     is based primarily on the MASTER project, a European Initiative for the description
                     of Western European Manuscripts. The main differences between the Repertorium and
                     TEI models are described in full in Appendices to these Guidelines, along with formal
                     definitions of Repertorium-specific changes and additions to the TEI P5 models.

                  <head>Standards and recommendations implied in TEI P5</head>
                  <p>Like every project that relies on TEI P5, the Repertorium 3.0 model is represented in XML 1.0 DTD (Bray et al. 2008) and Relax NG formats (Clark, Murata
                        2001, Clark 2002), and provides the possibility of transformation into other available
                        schema languages, which currently means W3C Schema language (Shudi, Sperberg,
                        Thomson 2009, Peterson et al. 2009).
                  </p>
                  <p>From the TEI P5 the Repertorium inherits the possibility of using all modern
                        standards technologies from the XML family, including, for example, XSL<note place="bottom">Which in turn consists of the XPath (Clark, DeRose 1999), XSLT (Clark 1999) and XSL-FO
                           (Berglund 2006) languages.
                     </note>, XML
                        Namespaces (Bray et al. 2006), XQuery language (Boag et al. 2011), XML Base
                        (Marsh, Tobin 2009), and others.
                  </p>
                  <p>Repertorium 3.0 inherits all constructions in the syntax of attribute values from the TEI
                        P5 infrastructure, where they are, in turn, expressed according to recommendations of the
                        W3 Consortium and ISO standards, and various RFCs and BCPs. The attribute values for
                        language codes follow BCP 47 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which comprises RFC 4646 (Philips,
                        Davis 2006a) and RFC 4647 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which, in turn, follow ISO standards
                        (cf. ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2). Four-letter codes for the names of scripts are from ISO 15924
                        (ISO 15924). Data in attributes that provide pointers to other locations in the same or in
                        other documents (e.g., target or lemmaRef) should be expressed in terms of RFC 3986
                        (Berners-Lee et al 2005). Temporal expressions in attributes follow the W3C XML Schema
                        recommendation or ISO 8601 (cf. Shudi, Sperberg, Thomson 2009, Peterson et al 2009, ISO
                        8601).

                        mation. In the current version this approach has been abandoned in favour of transformation to
                        HTML (Altheim, McCarron 2001) and possibly to PDF through XSLT and XSL-FO scripts<note place="bottom">See, in the TEI P5 Guidelines, the chapter about linking and segmentation, which represents

               </head>
               <p>Until now the Repertorium Initiative has had no Public Identifier (PI), and instead used
                        system identifiers (SI) and XML catalog files (cf. Bray et al. 2008, Walsh 2001). Beginning
                        with the current version of the Repertorium guidelines, the following PI will be used: "<code>-//
                        Repertorium//DTD Repertorium XML V3.0/EN"</code>.
               </p>
               <p>For use with modern schema languages an XML Namespace designation is needed.
                        A possible candidate is the xmlns re with the value "<code>http://www.ilit.bas.bg/repertorium/
                        ns/3.0</code>". All elements from the TEI namespace tei preserve their value despite the fact that
                        their content could be changed in some way, and only elements that are not present in the TEI
                        models are implemented in the Repertorium namespace.

               <head>The modules</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative was intended from the ground up to be constructed as a model
                        for the description of medieval Slavic manuscripts. However in its XML implementation it
                        also has the ability to serve as a framework for the description of other medieval traditions,
                        such as Greek or Latin, because the philological approaches for such investigations are much
                        more similar than different. The structures of catalogues of medieval European manuscripts
                        share most of the same features and should give answers to the same questions related to
                        manuscript contents, palaeography and codicology.</p>
               <p>Using the TEI infrastructure makes it possible to implement several parts of an electronic
                        text project within the same model. For example, it becomes possible to express all imaginable
                        aspects of text edition, source description and graphical representation of a text object, provid-
                        ing ready-to-use models at least in the following areas:
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>description of the source (in our case, a manuscript)</item>
                  <item>edition of the text (with the appropriate segmentation into separate text units, apparatus criticus, annotation of linguistic features, pointers to the graphical representation of the
                        original source, etc.)</item>
                  <item>encoding bibliographic records related to description and edition</item>

               <p>The TEI model that has served as the foundation for the Repertorium schema is designed
                        specifically to support the description of medieval manuscripts.</p>

               <p>In the most recent Repertorium model, based on TEI P5, the modules for drama
                        and performance, verse and feature structures were represented. In practice they have
                        never been used in our work, and they have therefore been removed from the current
                        model.
               </p>
               <p>In comparison with the customized TEI P5 manuscript description schema, three

               <head>Some principles</head>
               <p>It was necessary to make a very precise comparison between the TEI P5 module
                        for manuscript description and the Repertorium model in order to reach the maximum
                        level of compatibility and interchangeability. To fulfill this task several principles
                        were formulated to govern that transformation of the prior Repertorium schema into
                        the present one:
               </p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>All attributes and elements from the core and additional tag sets that have
                           been changed from TEI P4 to TEI P5 are changed in Repertorium 3.0, as well.
                  </item>
                  <item>All attributes and elements that share the same functionality between TEI P5
                           and Repertorium are renamed in favour of TEI P5.
                  </item>
                  <item>No customizations are made on the level of TEI macro structures or on the
                           level of model classes with the exception of

                        <item>exclusion of all numbered <code>divLike</code> models and their corresponding elements.

                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>When there is an element with the same name in TEI P5 and the Repertorium,
                        it is declared in the TEI, not the Repertorium, namespace, even if the given element
                        name has its roots in Repertorium Initiative.</item>
                  <item>When there is no functional possibility in the Repertorium model to express
                           particular features, the elements from TEI P5 with their names are taken without further customization. This is the case, for example, with element <gi>additional</gi>.
                  </item>
                  <item>When the same information with the same functional characteristics is expressed in different places in TEI P5 and the Repertorium, the choice is made in favour
                           of the former. This is the case with the definition of manuscript origin. In early versions
                           of the Repertorium schema this was expressed with a special element <gi>manuscriptCreation</gi>, placed before the content description. However, in TEI P5 there is an element <gi>origin</gi> with a similar function, which is part of the manuscript history, placed
                                 almost at the end of the schema. In this case the latter element has been chosen.
                  </item>
                  <item>When elements with different names share the same functional characteristics
                           even if their declarations differ to some extent, the elements from the TEI namespace are chosen. This is the case, for example, with the element <gi>msItemStruct</gi>,
                              which replaces the original Repertorium <gi>articleContentDesc</gi>
                     <note place="inline">Remove: TEI has allready this attribute:</note>, and the element
                     <gi>filiation</gi> with the special attribute <att>type</att> which replaces <gi>antigraph</gi>,                     <gi>apograph</gi>,                     <gi>litRedaction</gi>,                     <gi>protograph</gi>,                     <gi>source</gi> and <gi>translation</gi>.
                                 
                  </item>
                  <item>If one of the models provides a more general and simpler view and the other has a structured model of the same information, an attempt is made to integrate
                           both approaches in the declaration of element. This is the case, for example, with the
                     <gi>bindingDesc</gi>. The declaration of this element in TEI P5 is:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                              element bindingDesc {

                     </egXML>
                     <p>Then the content of <gi>binding</gi> is declared as</p>

                  <item> If there is an element in the Repertorium that has the same name as in TEI P5
                           but a different meaning, the Repertorium element is removed or renamed. An example
                           of such an element is <gi>writing</gi>, which was used in earlier Repertorium schemas to
                              provide general palaeographic information. An element with the same name exists in
                              P5 with a completely different meaning („a passage of written text revealed to participants in the course of a spoken text", cf. Burnard, Bauman 2007), so the Repertorium
                              element was changed to <gi>summary</gi> in the schema.
                  </item>
                  <item>Specific Repertorium elements and structures from earlier versions are retained only if there are structural or semantic differences between the Repertorium
                           and TEI models. One example is the element <gi>scribeDesc</gi>, which represent different points of view for manuscript description and is presented in a different way by
                              the TEI P5 Guidelines.
                  </item>
                  <item>If in the TEI P5 Guidelines an element can be used with more than one meaning, then
                           an attempt is made to clarify the usage. This pertains to elements such as <gi>msIdentifier</gi>,
                     <gi>altIdentifier</gi>,                     <gi>msPart</gi> and <gi>accMat</gi>.

      <head>The main Structure</head>
      <p>A manuscript description can occur in two different places in a Repertorium
               XML document. When the description (cataloguing information) serves as an introduction to the digital representation of transcribed text, it is encoded inside the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element that provides metadata for the edition itself. However, when the
                  goal of the project is focused on manuscript descriptions, without transcribed full text,
                  the descriptive elements and content are regarded as primary data and the description
                  itself becomes a primary object. In this case it serves no longer as metadata and must
                  be entered as part of the content of the element <gi>body</gi>.
      </p>
      <p>The basic, wrapper element for a description is called <gi>msDesc</gi> (manuscript
               description) and it serves as a container for seven additional parts: general cataloguing
               information (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>); headings (<gi>head</gi>); information on physical characteristics and layout of the manuscript (<gi>physDesc</gi>); palaeographical and linguis-
                     tic data (<gi>scribeDesc</gi>); the description of the manuscript content as a whole, as
                        separate texts, and its notes and colophon(s) (<gi>msContents</gi>); conclusions about the
                           time and place of writing of the manuscript and a sketch of the manuscript’s history
                           (         <gi>history</gi>); as well as a place for additional information the describer may need to
                              encode (element <gi>additional</gi>).
      </p>
      <p>Convolutes and palimpsest parts are described as part of the element <gi>msPart</gi>
         <note place="bottom">Cf. <ref target="convolutes">Description of convolutes</ref>,            <ref target="palimpsests">Description of palimpsests</ref>.
         </note>.
               Additional notes by the authors of earlier descriptions and by owners of the manuscript form part of the element <gi>accMat</gi>.
      </p>
      <p>The specification of the source could be extended further as part of the <gi>recordHist</gi>
               (recorded history) element at the end of the description (cf. <ref target="#additional_info">Additional information</ref>).
      </p>
      <p>Only one part of this information is mandatory and must always appear in the
               description: <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. All other main elements are optional.
      </p>
      <p>Information is entered step by step, in an ordered and purposeful way. The first
               step concerns general cataloguing information, then comes information related to
               physical features of the manuscript, palaeography, language, content, sources of man-
               uscript description and, finally, administrative information, such as custodial history,
               restoration, available photocopies and bibliographic information.</p>

         <head>Levels of representation</head>
         <p>Descriptions of medieval manuscripts may differ significantly both in structure
                  and length. There exist many traditions in cataloguing medieval materials, which
                  means that similar information can look different in different frameworks. The first
                  thing to consider is the completeness and length of the description.

            <head>Description with the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and <gi>head</gi> elements</head>
            <p>The briefest possible description consists of the elements <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and
               <gi>head</gi>, as shown in the following example:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <p>Even this check-list description could be further segmented into more discrete

            <p>We attach <att>type</att> to the element <gi>head</gi> to make a distinction between the proper headings in some editions and the heading that serves as a brief statement here.
                     Next we encode each valuable piece of information by giving it a name. A possible
                     rationale for this more complete approach would be the extraction of or search for specific pieces of data, or the attachment to it of specific formatting during rendering.

            <p>In this example the cataloguing model consists of the identification of the codex (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>) and a sequence of paragraphs, each of which provides
                        information that is identified with the help of <att>xml:id</att>. The choice of paragraph types
                        can be determined by the goals of the individual project.

            <head>Extraction of information from a full description</head>
            <p>Another way to obtain information in the form of a checklist or short catalogue is
                     to extract already existing data from an analytical description. For this purpose, the form
                     of the full-length catalogue must follow encoding rules that will allow data extraction
                     without loss of information. For example, small summaries or overviews might coexist
                     with more elaborated, structured features of manuscript or text analysis, e.g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msContents>

         <head>General remarks</head>
         <p>Cataloguing information is an obligatory part of each manuscript description and
                  it should provide an introduction for researchers consisting of:
         </p>
         <list>
            <item>identification of manuscript name, as a type or genre (e.g., <emph>Menaion</emph> or <emph>Triodion</emph>) or
                     as a specific name that has become standardized in the research tradition (e.g., <emph>Euchologium Sinaiticum</emph>);
            </item>
            <item>information about where the manuscript is kept, together with its shelfmark(s);</item>
            <item>optional additional notes</item>
         </list>
         <p>The description thus begins with answers to questions like: What is the name of
                  the manuscript? Where it is now kept? and Are there earlier descriptions? The answers to all
                  of these questions constitute part of the content of the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (i.e.,
                     manuscript identifier, Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007).
         </p>
         <p>The encoder can provide information about the name of the manuscript
                  (            <gi>msName</gi>) if it exists, and about the country, geographical region and/or city,
                     and the institution, repository, or collection (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: <code>model.
                     placeNamePart</code>).
         </p>
         <p>Between <gi>msName</gi> and following structured information it is possible to insert
                  a brief summary description in the form of paragraph (cf. below). More information,
                  including optional bibliographic records or lists of records, may be entered as part of
                  the element <gi>note</gi>.
         </p>
         <p>The element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (manuscript identifier) has <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes. These attributes may be used, for example, when the manuscript is
                  now lost or its place is now unknown, so that the type of identifier is not current, and
                  the electronic form represents an encoding of an old description, and not the de visu
                  work of the current encoder.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head xml:id="msName">The Manuscript Name</head>
         <p>The name of the manuscript is a word or a short phrase that can be used to clasify the manuscript according to a known scheme and to provide a special or supplied
                  name that has become established by the research tradition.
         </p>
         <p>There are many characteristics involved in assigning a name to a manuscript.
                  The most important is the so-called generic or unified name, based on typological

            <item>
               <code>msName type="general"</code> identifies the genre of the manuscript in a general way, e.g., "miscellany". This is the only <gi>msName</gi> that is required for all manuscript description files, and it must be given only in English. The Bulgarian and Russian names will be retrieved later from a list, which means that if the name isn’t in the list, it will need to be added. General names do not have subtypes.</item>
            <item>
               <code>msName type="specific"</code> identifies the genre of the manuscript in a specific way, e.g., "apocryphal miscellany". This name is optional, but if it is present, it must be given only in English, and is subject to the same look-up treatment as general names, described above. Specific names do not have subtypes.</item>
            <item>
               <code>msName type="individual"</code> identifies the individual name(s) by which the manuscript is known, e.g., "Loveč miscellany". This name is optional and repeatable, but if it is given, it must be given in all three languages. To encode a former individual manuscript name, add the <att>subtype</att> attribute with the value "old"; "old" is the only legal value of @subtype here, and in the absence of a <att>subtype</att> attribute the name is assumed to be current.</item>

         <p>The use of this paragraph is restricted to cases when special annotation is needed
                  to summarize the locations of different parts of the same manuscript. The current location in different countries, archives, or collections could require a special introduction
                  to this state with possible links to sections on manuscript history, acquisition, and to
                  the various signatures or numbers in the catalogues. The following extract from the
                  description of <emph>Manuilev Apostolos</emph> illustrates this approach:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

         <p>This short introduction to the cataloguing information in the description of the
                  Manuilev Apostle is needed to understand the rest of the description. The formal declaration of the element <gi>p</gi> (paragraph) is used exactly as the same element in
                     TEI models (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: p).

            <p>The next part of the electronic cataloguing information is devoted to the place
                     where the manuscript is kept. There are three levels for this information: geographical
                     pointers, institutional identification, and (optionally) data regarding the collection in
                     which the manuscript is kept. The latter often appears as part of the shelfmark designation.
            </p>
            <p>The specified order of elements is important, going from largest to smallest:</p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>country</item>
               <item>geographical region</item>
               <item>city or place name</item>
               <item>repository</item>
               <item>collection</item>
               <item>shelfmark, inventory number or some other designation</item>
            </list>
            <p>This set of elements is followed by optional information on identification based
                     on <term>secundo folio</term> and bibliographic records.
            </p>
            <p>Following example from the description of Ms NBKM 848 illustrates the usage
                     of the element:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <country>Bulgaria</country>
                  <settlement>Plovdiv</settlement>

                  <idno type="shelfmark">25</idno>

         <div>
            <head>Country</head>
            <p>The most simple content of the element <gi>country</gi> is the name of country, e.g.:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <country>Bulgaria</country>
            </egXML>
            <p>In some cases it may be useful to provide a country code as well as a country
                     name. This can be achieved by supplying a value to the <att>key</att> attribute. It is recommended by the TEI that this value follow the country names and codes defined by ISO
                     3166 (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: country). The encoder can choose among three
                     representations defined in the standard: alpha-2 code (two-letter, ISO 3166-1-alpha-2-
                     code), alpha-3 code (three-letter, ISO 3166-1-alpha-3-code), and numeric code (ISO
                     3166-numeric). The three variants are illustrated below:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <country key="BG">Bulgaria</country>

         <div>
            <head>Settlement (city or town, etc.)</head>
            <p>The next part of the information is related to the place where the manuscript is
                     currently kept. Two different elements are provided for this purpose. In most cases the
                     manuscript is kept in libraries or archives in cities, for which the element <gi>settlement</gi>
                     is used:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <settlement>Sankt Peterburg</settlement>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The type of settlement may be further specified by adding a standard type, as in
                     this example:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <settlement type="town">Kazanlăk</settlement>
               </egXML>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Region</head>
            <p>When the name of place is not well-known or there could be two or more
                     places with the same name, an additional element <gi>region</gi> may be added. By <gi>region</gi> is meant an administrative unit smaller than a country but larger than a city, town or village (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: <code>region</code>).
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <region type="district">Sofia</region>
                  <settlement type="village">Alino</settlement>
               </egXML>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>The place and geographical names</head>
            <p>When the codex is kept in a specific place not normally considered a region
                     or settlement, e.g., in a monastery, the alternative elements <gi>placeName</gi> and
               <gi>geogName</gi> may be used. These elements are part of the TEI element infrastructure
                           and may contain plain text, sub-elements like <gi>region</gi> (for some places that are
                              smaller than countries, but bigger than cities) or <gi>district</gi> (for names of non-
                                 administrative, geographical places). With the help of <gi>geogFeat</gi> we can encode
                                    such geographical features as valley, river, mount, etc. (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:
                                    geogFeat). Then we can provide the name of the place using general purpose <gi>name</gi>
                                       element.
            </p>
            <p>The choice in this case should be made on the level of the whole project, unifying the appearance of the information in order to format, transform or search the data.
                     For example, a possible encoding for manuscripts kept at the <emph>Zograph Monastery</emph> on
               <emph>Mount Athos</emph> could look like the following:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <geogName>
                     <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                     <name>Athos</name>
                  </geogName>
                  <placeName type="monastery">Zograph monastery</placeName>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The same information could be encoded in two other ways. The first is using a
                     general purpose element <gi>name</gi> with <att>type</att>, e. g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <name type="monastery">Zograph monastery</name>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The other is to use a special referencing string as the value of the <att>key</att> attribute,
                     e. g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <placeName key="ZM" type="monastery">Zograph
                        Monastery</placeName>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>In the last example the <gi>placeName</gi> element has two special attributes. As
                     explained in the TEI Guidelines <att>key</att> „provides an externally-defined means of iden-
                     tifying the entity (or entities) being named, using a coded value of some kind." (Bur-
                     nard &amp; Bauman 2007: <code>att.canonical/key</code>) and <att>type</att> is intended to be used as a
                     general characteristic of the place name. That means that project should have a list of
                     abbreviations of some sort, one of which must be ZM (= Zograph Monastery). For the
                     manuscripts kept at Mount Sinai "St. Catherine" the same model is also valid, e.g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <country>Egypt</country>
                  <geogName>
                     <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                     <name>Sinai</name>
                  </geogName>
               </egXML>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Repository (library, archive, etc.)</head>
            <p>The next piece of information in the electronic description, <gi>repository</gi>,
                     identifies a public or private library or archive. This element should contain a common
                     or official designation, as in this example:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <country>Czech Republic</country>
                  <settlement>Prague</settlement>

         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Name of the institution</head>
            <p>Sometimes the repository part of another institution, and in such cases the name of
                     the institution comes before the name of the archive, as in the following examples:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <institution>University of Sofia</institution>

               </egXML>
                     or
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <institution>Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</institution>

            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Shelfmarks, inventory and catalogue designations</head>
            <p>This information forms the content of the element <gi>idno</gi>. This element has
                     an <att>type</att> value that specifies whether the identification is a shelfmark, inventory
                     number, or catalogue number. This attribute value is especially important in archives
                     that combine several collections that may be arranged and identified according to
                     former owners or thematic principles. In practice, shelfmarks are often formed from
                     the initials or special codes for separate collections. Typical examples could be:
            </p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>shelfmark:

            <head>Collections</head>
            <p>Some repositories use a complex archiving system with special divisions be-
                     tween the separate collections and archives. Very often the names of the sections bear
                     the names of previous owners or commissioners, which can be represented with the
               <gi>collection</gi> element. The <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes are available for
                        cases where a more detailed characterization is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>collection</gi> element may contain unstructured (plain) text, e.g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <collection>П. Сырку</collection>
                  <idno>15</idno>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>In this fragment it is stated that the collection belongs to the gatherings of P.
                     Syrku under the number 15.
            </p>
            <p>When thе <gi>collection</gi> element appears, it is immediately followed by the
                     shelfmark or inventory number as an identification inside the collection:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msIdentifier>
                           ...
                     <collection>M. Pogodin</collection>
                     <idno type="shelfmark">Pog. 1204</idno>
                     <altIdentifier type="current">
                        <idno type="catalogue">77</idno>
                     </altIdentifier>
                              ...
                  </msIdentifier>
               </egXML>
               <cit>
                  <bibl>(From the electronic description of a Vidin Miscellany by Antoaneta Granberg)
                  </bibl>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>In some cases the current collection of some repository contains an entire earlier
                     repository collection. This is often the case in Russian collections like the National
                     Russian Library in Sankt-Petersburg, the Historical Museum, the State Russian Lib­
                     rary and the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts. In this case it is helpful to include
                     this information, as well, e.g.:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

         <head>Once again about the usage of <gi>altIdentifier</gi> and <gi>idno</gi> elements</head>
         <p>In an analytical catalogue where there may be combinations of former and current collections and shelfmarks in a repository it is often useful to encode all these
                  designations. The encoder can then further explain the history of the manuscript in
                  sections about its origin, provenance and acquisition.
         </p>
         <p>
            <note place="inline">Edited: </note>The usage of <gi>altIdentifier</gi> in the Repertorium approach as a subelement
                  of <gi>msIdentifier</gi> is to define the current or former alternative identification of a codex.
         </p>
         <p>
            <note place="inline">Edited: </note>The element <gi>idno</gi>, on the other hand, is used for various kinds of designations, such as shelfmarks, inventory or catalogue numbers. In this approach, if we
                  have a part of the manuscript in one repository with an old shelfmark or collection
                  identification that is still in use, it is necessary to allow <gi>altIdentifier</gi> to appear
                     elsewhere, in the description of other parts, as in:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <altIdentifier type="partial" xml:id="RSL_Grig14">
                  <country>Russia</country>
                  <settlement>Moscow</settlement>
                  <repository>Russian State Library</repository>
                  <idno type="shelfmark">Grig. 14</idno>
                  <collection>V. Grigorovic</collection>
                  <altIdentifier type="former">
                     <idno type="shelfmark">M. 1696</idno>
                  </altIdentifier>
               </altIdentifier>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>In this example both Grig. 14 and M.<note place="bottom"> An abbreviation of Muzejnoe sobranie, or Museum collection. This points to the previous name
                  of the library, which existed until 1925 as a private collection of Count Н. Rumjancev.
            </note> 1696 are used as identifications in the
                  tradition in spite of the fact that the latter points to the previous owner. In this case the
                  shelfmark signifies the intermediate change of owner. Further details should be given
                  in the section about the history of the codex.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Secundo folio</head>
         <p>This element is very rare in the Slavic medieval and early modern tradition,
                  but for western medieval manuscripts it has been (mainly between the thirteenth and
                  sixteenth centuries) a common component of manuscript description. The term refers
                  to transcribing the first word or words from the second leaf of a codex. The element
            <gi>secFol</gi> (lat. secundo folio, or eng. second folio) is used for this purpose (Burnard
                     &amp; Bauman 2007: secFol). The following example illustrates the usage:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

      <div>
         <head xml:id="additional_info">Additional information in the catalogue descrption</head>
         <p>All other data could be entered at the end of <gi>msIdentifier</gi> or <gi>altIdentifier</gi>
                  elements as part of the content of a <gi>note</gi> element. Typical information includes internal or
                     external bibliographic or other pointers, notes about the attribution of a manuscript, etc.

         <p>The markup definition of the physical structure should be entered in the element
            <gi>physDesc</gi> (            <ref target="#TEI">TEI P5: Chapter 10.7</ref>), which unites information about the physical
                     condition of the manuscript with observations about the material, layout, binding and
                     decoration. The encoder can choose between two options:
         </p>
         <list rend="numbered">
            <item>To make a very short sketch of different features of the manuscript in paragraphs, or
            </item>
            <item> To use special elements for the description of material, layout, binding, decoration, etc.
            </item>
         </list>
         <p>For the former approach the encoder should use only paragraphs, as in this
                  example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <physDesc>
                  <p>4+516 ff. (Stojanov wrongly gives 273ff.). Paper with watermark three
                        cylinders with letters FA. 230 x 180 mm. In 1 column, 30 lines per page</p>
                  <p>Greek cursive of the 19th century.</p>

                        ></p>
                  <p>The codex is in good condition. The folios containing the Table of contents
                        are now unfolded. Originally they formed the last quire of the manuscript</p>
               </physDesc>
            </egXML>
            <cit>

            </cit>
         </p>
         <p>The element <gi>physDesc</gi> has no special attributes. Its only use is to contain
                  other elements, which encode the physical characteristics of the manuscript.
         </p>
         <p>The second approach also permits the use of the element <gi>p</gi>, in this case for an
                  introduction to the physical description.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Description of material and layout</head>
         <p>Information about manuscript materials and their characteristics and about the layout of the leaves is encoded within <gi>objectDesc</gi>. This element has one special attribute, <att>form</att>. The proposed values (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007) of this attribute could
                     be codex, roll, fragment, leaf, partial leaf or some typologically relevant value, e.g.
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <objectDesc form="codex">
                           ...						
               </objectDesc>
            </egXML>
                  or
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <objectDesc form="roll">

               </objectDesc>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>This information could be entered as an unstructured sequence of paragraphs, or as
               part of the content of the specialized elements <gi>supportDesc</gi> and <gi>layoutDesc</gi> .
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Description of physical support</head>
         <p>The information in <gi>supportDesc</gi> could be also entered in two ways: 1) as an
                  unstructured (paragraph) view, or 2) using specialized elements. Here we illustrate an
                  overview of the use of structured data for various aspects of cataloguing the support.
         </p>
         <p>
            <gi>supportDesc</gi> has one important attribute, <att>material</att>. The value of this
                  attribute, as suggested by TEI Guidelines (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:
            <code>supportDesc</code>), is most commonly <emph>parchment</emph>,            <emph>paper</emph>, or <emph>mixed</emph>, as in this

         <p>The meaning of the value of this attribute is to give a general type of the material
                  of the manuscript, and it is not associated with the possible construction of manuscript’s binding or the box in which the manuscript is kept. Especially in cases when
                  the value is „mixed," a further explanation should be provided.
         </p>
         <p>The order of information in this element is significant, and follows traditional
                  paper-based descriptions. There is no required minimal content, and the range of in-
                  formation depends on the opportunities the researcher may have had to work with the
                  manuscript <emph>de visu</emph>. The brief explanation of the proposed elements is as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
            <gi>support</gi> – describes in more detail the material of the leaves or roll;</p>
         <p>
            <gi>extent</gi> – describes the size of manuscript in terms like number
                     of
                     folia or pages, or the length of the roll;</p>
         <p>
            <gi>foliation</gi> and/or <gi>pagination</gi> – information about whether the
                        manuscript is foliated (paginated), with further explanation;
         </p>
         <p>
            <gi>collation</gi> – description of the folia collation, ruling, pricking and
                           other techniques related to the quire structure;</p>
         <p>
            <gi>condition</gi> – an overview of possible damage, absence or additions of folia,
                              blank leaves, etc.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Detailed description of material</head>
         <p>This information could be entered as plain text in the form of paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>)
                  in the element <gi>support</gi> or as one or more instances of the element <gi>material</gi>.
                     It contains a brief statement that can serve as an overview of a more in-depth description that can follow. Here is an example of the first type:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <support>
                  <p>Paper with <watermark>Harbalet in Ring</watermark>: similar to
                     <bibl>Harlfinger Nr. 2/a</bibl> from the years 1471-1472</p>
               </support>
            </egXML>
            <cit>
               <bibl>(From the electronic description of MS Rila 3/6 by Dilyana Radoslavova, simpified</bibl>
            </cit>
         </p>
         <p>However, in the case of an analytical description we may choose to use a para-
                  graph as just an introduction to a more elaborate description of the material, or we
                  may use only one or more <gi>material</gi> elements, often depending on the complete-
                     ness of information we have. For example, if we are describing a manuscript that we
                     have not been able to examine de visu, or are making an electronic editon of an old
                     catalogue, we may lack information about the paper or quality of parchment. In such
                     cases we may ignore the <gi>support</gi> section of description and provide the informa-
                        tion we do have only as the value of the attribute <att>material</att> in the element <gi>supportDesc</gi>, as in the example above.
         </p>
         <p>In contrast with this, when we use one or more <gi>material</gi> elements not as part
                  of <gi>p</gi>, that means that we have enough information to complete a parchment or paper
                     description of the codex. Consider the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <supportDesc material="mixed">
                  <support>

               </supportDesc>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>Here the <att>key</att> attribute is used to distinguish the different materials in the manu-
                  script. The element <gi>material</gi> can include an attribute <att>function</att>, with values that might include (but are not limited to):

         <p>The parchment description is restricted to the technological process and its outer
                  appearance. However, the encoder might wish to add a statement regarding the origin,
                  quality, colour and thickness of the parchment, as in this example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <head>General remarks
            </head>
            <p>The description of paper in recent catalogues is much more complicated than the
                     description of parchment. On the one hand, there are various levels of detailed infor-
                     mation in the catalogues, and, on the other, there are much more specialized research
                     initiatives in the field of paper and watermark studies. Therefore, the description of
                     the paper in a manuscript could consist of an overview and comments followed by a
                     description of watermark(s) and of other aspects of the paper production:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <material function="original">
                     <dim type="format">4°</dim>thick, rough, non-
                              glazed
                              paper </material>
               </egXML>
               <cit>
                  <bibl>From the electronic description of Add. Ms 37233

               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>The description of obviously different kind of paper, possibly from various manufactures, and of varying quality and age could be accomplished by repeating the element <gi>material</gi> and its attributes exactly in the same manner as it is implemented
                     for the description of parchment.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Watermarks</head>
            <p>The central and most important information in the description of the paper
                     is the watermark. The information on its characteristics is part of the element
               <gi>watermark</gi>. The content of this element includes phrase level elements, as well
                        as specialized elements like <gi>countermark</gi> and <gi>motif</gi>.
            </p>
            <p>The following structure should be observed:</p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>If there are no watermarks in the manuscript, the contents of the <gi>watermark</gi> element must be the bare text "None";</item>
               <item>If there are watermarks in the manuscript, there must be exactly <gi>motif</gi> element as the first child of <gi>watermark</gi> (except when it is preceded by <gi>locus</gi>; see below). We do not distinguish among basic, supplemental, and additional parts of the <gi>motif</gi>. The <gi>motif</gi> element is the only required child of <gi>watermark</gi>.
               </item>
               <item>If there is a <gi>countermark</gi> element, it must be the first following sibling of <gi>motif</gi>. A <gi>countermark</gi> element must have a single <gi>motif</gi> child element; <gi>countermark</gi> is not allowed to contain plain text.</item>
               <item>The third part of the watermark information (but see the discussion of "similar to" below) is a pointer to a watermark album. The reference itself is encoded as a <gi>ref</gi> element with a <att>target</att> attribute, the value of which is a bibliographic pointer in the form "FamilynameYear". The <gi>ref</gi> element has two obligatory children: <gi>num</gi> (the number of an tracing in the album) and <gi>date</gi>, containing the year or range of years recorded in the album for that tracing. In the case of multiple examples of the same motif from the same album, there may be more than one <gi>num</gi> and <gi>date</gi> pair, but each <gi>num</gi> must have its own <gi>date</gi>, even when the date is the same as the date of the preceding item.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Names of motifs are to be given in English according to the usage preferred in the <ref target="http://www.memoryofpaper.eu/products/watermark_terms_en.pdf">Memory of paper</ref> project.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <watermark>
                  <motif>Anchor in circle with star</motif>
                  <countermark>
                     <motif>AB</motif>
                  </countermark>
                  <ref target="bib:Moshin1973">
                     <num>1393</num>
                     <date>1560/75</date>
                  </ref>
               </watermark>
            </egXML>
            <p>This will be rendered on line as:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     Anchor in circle with star and AB countermark. Moshin 1973: 1393 (1560/75).
            </egXML>
            <p>If there is more than one watermark in the manuscript and the description distinguishes them by location, the element <gi>locus</gi> is used as the first child of <gi>watermark</gi>, before <gi>motif</gi>. For example: </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <watermark>
                  <locus>ff. 132-140</locus>
                  <motif>Two circles with a cross</motif>
                  <ref target="bib:Moshin1973">
                     <num>2025</num>
                     <date>1336</date>
                  </ref>
               </watermark>
            </egXML>
            <p>If the tracing is similar to, but not the same equal as, the watermark being described, a <gi>term</gi> element with the textual content "similar to" to appear before the <gi>ref</gi> element. For example:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <watermark>
                  <locus>ff. 50, 256</locus>
                  <motif>axe</motif>
                  <term>similar to</term>
                  <ref target="bib:Piekosinski1893">
                     <num>413</num>
                     <date>1395</date>
                  </ref>
               </watermark>
            </egXML>
            <p>There are several special attributes for the content of this element. <att>tracing</att>
                     is used to describe very briefly (with one word) the method of watermark tracing. The
                     most usual method is still drawing by hand, but there could be other possibilities like
                     rubbing by hand, usage of special Dylux print paper, beta- or x-radiography, scanning, etc. Further more the <att>place</att> from the <code>class att.placement</code> can refine
                     where on the pages the watermark could be seen. This feature could be described in
                     relation to wire lines and chain (laid) lines. The possible content might read something like: <emph>chain lines regularly spaced</emph>,               <emph>between chain lines more widely spaced</emph>,               <emph>on
                     a chain line</emph>,               <emph>on a supplemental chain line</emph>,               <emph>across 2 chain lines</emph>,               <emph>across 3 chain lines</emph>,
                     or could be expressed in some other terms, e.g., in millimeters between various points
                     of the leaf.
            </p>
            <div>
               <head>Motif</head>
               <p>The element <gi>motif</gi> is the most important part of the watermark description
                        because it is intended to give a special terminological apparatus of watermark design.
               </p>
               <p>There are several ways to add information on this subject:
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>In the absence of reference books and watermark albums, simply as
                           plain text;
                  </item>
                  <item>If a more complicated motif is present and the encoder would like to
                           provide full compatibility with professional watermark databases, with the
                           attribute <att>type</att>, as described below;
                  </item>
                  <item>By <term>secondary</term> is meant designs above or below the basic motif. Frequent-
                           ly used motifs above the basic one include bird, cross, flower, monograms,
                           monograms with a combination with figures (e.g., monogram BA and cross),
                           ramrod, different star shapes, star and monogram, trefoil, etc. Frequently used
                           motifs below the basic one include grapes, monograms, etc.;
                  </item>
                  <item>By <term>supplemental</term> is meant supplemental characteristics of the basic motif,
                           e.g., in circle, in oval, in shield, etc.
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In this approach the usual description of the motif “anchor in circle with 5-point
                        star above" could be encoded as:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <motif type="basic">anchor<motif type="supplemental">in
                              circle</motif>
                        <motif type="secondary">with
                              star/5-point above</motif>
                     </motif>
                  </egXML>
               </p>
               <p>Names of motifs are to be given in English according to the usage preferred in the <ref target="http://www.memoryofpaper.eu/products/watermark_terms_en.pdf">Memory of paper</ref> project.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Countermark</head>
               <p>A countermark has the same content and attributes as the <gi>watermark</gi> element. Example:

               <item> The density of the wire lines as the measure of 20 wirelines (in mm) — a standard pro-
                        cedure common in paper descriptions;
               </item>
               <item>Description of wire lines, usually in terms like: thin wire lines; thick wire lines; alter-
                        nating thick and thin; very thick wire lines; thick wire lines, thin lines at edges; wire lines in
                        corrugated pattern; wires wrapped around the chain lines; alternate wires wrapped around the
                        chains; etc.
               </item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Chain or laid lines</term>: The most important feature of the chain lines is the spacing
                  between them, which could be described by entering the element <gi>dim</gi> and its sub
                  element <gi>height</gi>. The following are recommendations from the Watermark Initia-
                  tive: “If the watermark is on the chain line the spaces on either side of it should be
                  given in parentheses: 28,25,(15,14),28,25. If the watermark is positioned between
                  or across two chain lines, the space between them should be given in parentheses:
                  44,45,(50),47,43 “ (http://abacus.bates.edu/Faculty/wmarchive/FORM_ descriptions.html).
                  An example of such description is provided as well: “04. Wire/Chain line descrip-
                  tion: Density of Wirelines: 26 mm. for 20 wirelines. (style: thin wirelines) Chain line
                  Interval(s): / 50 mm."
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Paper thickness:</term> The data on paper thickness could be entered in the element
            <gi>dim</gi> with the <att>type</att> attribute and a thickness value. This value could be relative,
                  e.g.: very thin, thin, medium thin, medium, medium thick, thick, very thick; or, alterna-
                  tively, it could be measured in another way.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Paper colour</term>: This information could be entered as content of the element
            <gi>colour</gi>.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Texture:</term> Terms in common use include: <emph>smooth</emph>,            <emph>matte</emph>,            <emph>fuzzy</emph>,            <emph>patina</emph>,            <emph>glazed</emph>,
            <emph>bumpy</emph>, etc. One might also record whether the dark fibres and wire lines are visible
                  on the surface of the paper.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Stiffness</term>: Information about the stiffness of paper is rare in manuscript descriptions, but
                  possible values could include: <emph>stiff</emph>,            <emph>crisp</emph>,            <emph>supple</emph>,            <emph>limp</emph>, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Date of the paper</term>: Usually the dating of the paper is part of the watermark description.
                  This is the most familiar place because the watermark image is the most characteristic part
                  of the paper description. In addition to providing the date or date range, the encoder could
                  further specify the justification for the dating. Possible values could include:
            <list>
               <item>published watermark(s) cited in references;</item>
               <item>codex date given in scribal note;</item>
               <item>codex dated on palaeographical grounds;</item>
               <item>codex dated by comparison of papers;</item>
               <item>codex dated from other evidence;</item>
               <item>the paper associated with binding, etc.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>The date range could be entered with the asterisk (*) as a wildcard, so that, for
                  example, the expression 15** would mean the range from 1500 to 1599, 156*, from
                  1560 to 1569, and 156*-157* - each year from the 1560 up to the 1579.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>References</term>: The references are given as external reference element inside
                  the elements <gi>bibl</gi> or <gi>listBibl</gi>.

      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Number of leaves or folia</head>
         <p>The number of folia in the manuscript is entered in the element <gi>extent</gi>,
                  which may be accompanied by the element <gi>measure</gi> with the attribute <att>unit</att> in
                     order to say whether we mean leaves or pages. Consider the following example from
                     the description of the manuscript 369 from the Church Historical and Archival Institute in Sofia:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <extent>
                  <measure unit="folia">4+516 (Stojanov wrongly gives
                           73ff.)</measure>
               </extent>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>It is possible to include links to the information in the same file or outside it, e.g.:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <extent>2 <ref target="OENB146">(Vienna)
                  </ref>+171 (f.134 is a later insertion)
                  <ref target="RGB1689">(Moscow) </ref>
               </extent>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>This shows the location of the folia in both repositories. The Codex Marianus
                  consists of 2 ff. kept in Vienna and 171 in Moscow. The element <gi>ref</gi> adds a link to
                     the corresponding part of the description (<gi>msIdentifier</gi> or <gi>altIdentifier</gi>).
         </p>
         <p>An even more complicated example can be illustrated from the description of
                  the Manuilev Apostle, which is now separated into six pieces housed in three different
                  libraries:

            <head>General remarks
            </head>
            <p>All sorts of dimensions could be entered into the element <gi>dimensions</gi>, and
                     the attribute <att>type</att> gives a hint to the encoder of possible uses for the element. The
                     attribute <att>unit</att> provides three possible characteristics and <att>scope</att> emphasizes the
                     range of these dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>The element <gi>dimensions</gi> could be used in many places where measurement is requirement, and it has three special attributes for that purpose. The attribute
               <att>type</att> provides a common typology of the dimensions of a given manuscript source.
                     Possible values comprise all important parts of the manuscript physical description and
                     layout. Commonly used dimensions are those of <term>leaves</term>,               <term>page written area</term> and the <term>height</term>
                     of the characters or lines. The author of the description may, however, find it useful to
                     mention also the dimensions of the <term>ruled</term> or <term>pricked</term> region of the page and quire, as well
                     as to provide measurements for the <term>borders</term> as part of the binding. It is even possible to
                     distinguish the dimension of a single letter in comparison to the whole line.
            </p>
            <p>The most useful units of measurement in manuscript description are mm and cm,
                     but sometimes, especially in the description of initials, a measurement in <term>lines</term> per
                     page or characters per line (<term>chars</term>) could be more useful than exact measures.
            </p>
            <p>To supply information on the possible range of dimensions the compiler of the
                     catalogue information may find it convenient to use the attribute <att>scope</att> with the
                     exact value of a particular part of the manuscript.
            </p>
            <p>
               <gi>height</gi> – The height of some object given in units as part of the element <gi>dimensions</gi>;
            </p>
            <p>
               <gi>width</gi> – The width of an object given in units as part of the element <gi>dimensions</gi>;
            </p>
            <p>
               <gi>depth</gi> – The depth of an object given in units as part of the element <gi>dimensions</gi>.
            </p>


            <p>A possible example could be:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <dimensions unit="mm" type="folia">
                  <height>205</height>
                  <width>140</width>
               </dimensions>
            </egXML>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Other dimensions</head>
            <p>Any other dimensions can be supplied through the general-purpose element
               <gi>dim</gi>. For example, in measuring binding panels:
            </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <dimensions type="panels" unit="mm">

                  <width scope="all">220</width>
                  <dim type="thickness">85</dim>

         </div>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Foliation and pagination</head>
         <p>Both elements have the same content and structure, and include information
                  about when the foliation or pagination was made, whether it is original, and how the
                  folia or pages are marked or numbered, e.g.:
         </p>
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Collation</head>
         <p>The description of collation offers three alternatives: 1) to describe the general
                  collation using the element <gi>p</gi> for an unstructured description; 2) to begin with a
                     general overview using the element <gi>p</gi> but also to describe such characteristics as
                        signatures, catchwords, pricking, ruling or dispositions of folia in the gatherings in
                        separate elements; or 3) when some of the quires deviate from the general rules, to
                        describe them in one or more separate <gi>quire</gi> elements.
         </p>
         <p>A simple description could include the element <gi>p</gi> with a formula, e.g.:
         </p>
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <collation>
               <p>
                  <formula>I (8 -i), II(8), III(8-i), IV-XIX(8), XX(4.4+2), XXI(8
                     -8)</formula>

         <div>
            <head>Signatures</head>
            <p>An important part of the description of quires is how they are marked at their
                     beginning and/or end. The description should include a phrase defining the form and
                     place at the beginning and end of the quire, as well as any changes, e.g.:
            </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <signatures>The original markings of the quires through letters is preserved.</signatures>

         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Description of each quire</head>
            <p>The element <gi>quire</gi> brings together all possible features for the characterization of the quire, including number, composition, how and where there are marked,
                     and with the assistance of what tool.
            </p>
            <p>The element <gi>formula</gi> provides information about how the quire is composed,
                     of how many folia, etc. The content of this element is a formula. Consider the following example:
            </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <collation>

                     <formula>8 (-1-2-3-4-5-6)
                     </formula>
                  </quire>
                  <quire n="II-XXI">
                     <extent>8</extent>
                  </quire>
                  <quire n="XXII">
                     <extent>7</extent>
                     <formula>7 (-7)</formula>
                  </quire>
                  <quire n="XXIII">
                     <extent>2</extent>
                     <formula>6 (-1-2-3-4)
                     </formula>
                  </quire>
                           ...
               </collation>
            </egXML>
            <p>This means that first quire of the manuscript was formed of 8 ff., all of which,
                     with the exception of the f. 7, are now missing. Quires II to XXI have 8 ff. each. From
                     quire XXII one folio (7) is missing. The last, quire XXIII, consisted originally of 6 ff.
                     but only 2 of them (5 and 6) are preserved intact.

            <head>Gregory rule or the rule of parchment arrangement in the quire</head>
            <p>The arrangement of the parchment folia as part of the quire structure is entered
                     here. Only <term>de visu</term> observations can identify the sequence and order of parchment fo-
                     lia. There are two common abbreviations: HS – for the hair (dark) side, and FS – for
                     the flesh (light) side of the parchment.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the content of this element could be a sequence of HS and FS abbreviations, e.g.:
            </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <gregoryRule>HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS-FS|HS = HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS-FS|HS</gregoryRule>
            </egXML>
            <p>Here the sign | separates pages, – separates folia, and = signifies the middle of the quire.</p>
            <p>In cases where there is no rule, or there are deviations from it, this should be
                     stated explicitly. If the deviations are caused by the loss of leaves, it is possible to
                     insert a link pointing to the place where this loss is explained, e.g., in the content of
                     the element <gi>condition</gi>.

            <head>Ruling patterns and types</head>
            <p>Two kinds of information regarding medieval manuscripts could be entered in
                     the element <gi>ruling</gi>. The first is related to the ruling type defined by researchers
                     like Leroy (1976) or Gilissen (1977), who attempted to propose well-defined typologies of ruling types. In the other, information is related to the place of ruling in the quire, or the so called „scheme." The former could be expressed as a formula of ruled
                     lines for writing, and the latter could be visualized as simple graphic showing the
                     places in the quire where the ruling is accomplished, e.g.:

            <p>This scheme means that in this quire the ruling is made for each of the two folia: once
                     for the outer double leaf and once for the inner one (double sign &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;). The symbols &gt;
                     or &lt; mean that on the leaf there is just a trace of the ruling made on the previous leaf<note place="bottom">The symbols &lt; and &gt; are reserved characters in XML. In the encoded file they should be written
                        as &lt; for &lt; and &gt; for &gt;, respectively.

            <p>Such observations are relatively rare in the literature. However, as described by
                     Jones (1946a, 1946b), they could bear information on scriptorial techniques. Thus, it
                     is necessary to provide an element for such types of information.

         <head>Description of the page layout</head>
         <p>This description is entered as part of the element <gi>layoutDesc</gi> (Burnard &amp;
                  Bauman 2007). As in many other places in the model you can choose between un-
                  structured description (with element <gi>p</gi>) or structured data in the element <gi>layout</gi>, probably preceded by an introduction (element <gi>summary</gi>).
         </p>
         <p>The element <gi>layout</gi> has three special attributes: <att>columns</att>,            <att>writtenLines</att> and <att>ruledLines</att>. If there are no further explanations by the encoder, all the
                  information can be supplied through these attribute values:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <layoutDesc>
                  <layout columns="1" writtenLines="18" ruledLines="20"/>

         <head>Ink</head>
         <p>Information about the ink is presented usually as a simple phrase like “brown
                  dark ink for the basic text and red ink for the headings and small initials". However,
                  such descriptions could then be further developed in order to supply information on
                  ink composition, or its brightness or its loss of colour. A simple description could be:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <ink>Brown ink for the text and dark red for the initials</ink>

         <head>Decoration</head>
         <p>The element <gi>decoDesc</gi> is used to give information about manuscript illumi-
                  nation. There are two basic ways of using this element and the subelements of its struc-
                  ture. The first is to provide basic notions on the styles and art objects in the codex with
                  the help of the element <gi>p</gi> (paragraph). Another other way is to provide a thorough
                     description of each kind of manuscript decoration with the element <gi>decoNote</gi>,
                        possibly preceded by some kind of introduction (in the element <gi>summary</gi>). In the
                           second approach each <ident>decoNote</ident> is supplied with the attribute <att>type</att> and an appropriate value, e.g., miniatures, headpieces, tail-pieces, initials, borders, line-fillers, marginal, wash, etc. Here we will give some examples:

            <p>Information about binding in most of the descriptions is very brief, and consists

                     Done probably in 16th century". In most cases this information is entered in brief
                     descriptions using the sub-element <gi>p</gi> of the element <gi>bindingDesc</gi> (Burnard &amp;
                        Bauman 2007). The describer can supplement this with further notes about the binding
                        decoration (<gi>decoDesc</gi>) and its recent condition (<gi>condition</gi>).
            </p>
            <p>If the encoder prefers to use a structured description, a short statement should be
                     entered in the element <gi>binding</gi> as value of the attribute <att>contemporary</att>, such

            </p>
            <p>The encoder can include a short statement before continuing the description of
                     the binding, or or she can provide only this information. In the latter case he or she
                     could give information about all of the main parts of the book-binding structure and
                     decoration. For example:

            <p>All other aspects of the binding description, not covered by elements like <gi>decoDesc</gi> or <gi>condition</gi>, could be entered in the element <gi>bindingNote</gi> with

                              of bookbinding, such as edges (e.g., technology, beveling of edges), fly-leaves, etc.
                              The observations in fastening could include how the fastening is done, e.g., by
                                 peg and strap, by hook and clasp; the length or width of the elements could be measured; their place(s) could be described, etc. In furnishing the encoder should
                                    describe all the bosses, corner pieces, etc. that can be observed on the binding.

                     can also be sewn through the fold of the sections by hand. Three different patterns are
                     observed: sewing structure, sewing stitches, and sewing pattern<note place="bottom"> The following definitions and information are based on Pamela Spitzmueller’s paper (Spitzmueller 1982-1983)– “Trial Terminology for Describing Sewing Through the Fold," (the Paper Conservator, vol.7, 1982/83, and on the

                     etc. <term>Unsupported</term> = only sewing thread connecting the sections to each other. An un-
                     supported structure is commonly found in Greek, Islamic, and Oriental books.
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Sewing stitches</term>, which is the motion of a thread from a sewing station (hole) exit
                     to a sewing station entry. The classification could be as follows:
            <list>
               <item>
                  <term>Slip</term>: thread passes under itself;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Link</term>: thread passes under another thread;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Loop</term>: circle around a support;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Lap</term>: passes over a support;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Forward</term>: continues in the direction of progression;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Reverse</term>: continues to the previous direction of progression;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Drop</term>: moves downward;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Climb</term>: moves upward;</item>
               <item>
                  <term>Incline</term>: moves diagonally.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Sewing patterns</term>. The main patterns are:
            <list>
               <item>Fold patterns: sequence of thread visible inside the fold of the section. These are of
                        two types: Continuous pattern: thread passing in and out each sewing station to form a pat-
                        tern; and Periodic pattern: thread skipping sewing holes and leaves intervals between some
                        of the stations.
               </item>
               <item>Spine patterns: the pattern is formed by the stitches across the uncovered spine of the
                        book. Some spine patterns are: (1) Chain (formed by link stitches), (2) Bridge (by span), (3)
                        Ribs (by loop), (4) Herringbone (by loop and link), (5) Steps (by lap), etc.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>Interesting questions pertaining to the description of spines include:
            <list>
               <item>whether the form of the spine is rounded or flat (as an attribute @type);</item>
               <item>whether there are raised or smooth bands;</item>
               <item>the process of reinforcing the spine of a sewn book after gluing-up, rounding and
                        backing, and before covering or casing-in, known as lining or spine lining;</item>
               <item>whether there are headbands, whether they are double or triple, etc.; how they are
                        connected to the board; what their colours are; what material they're made from.</item>

         <head>Date of binding and place where it is made</head>
         <p>In most of the cases the binding of medieval manuscripts is latter then the
                     codex itself. Therefore the date and place of producing the binding should be
                     provided separately from the conclusions on date and place of origin of the
                     described book.
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <date certainty="likely">15 century</date>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes the exact date is known from a note by the copyist or book-
                     binder. In these cases a reference to the description and its edition should be
                     made, e.g.:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <date certainty="yes">1667<ref target="note1">cf. bookbinder’s
                           note</ref>
               </date>
            </egXML>
            <cit>
               <bibl>From Tachiaos 1981: 69–70, No 25</bibl>
            </cit>
         </p>
         <p>In this case the <gi>date</gi> element bears the attribute <att>certainty</att> with the value
            <emph>yes</emph> and this information is further referenced with the <att>target</att> attribute value note1.
                     As in all other cases with the elements <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi>, such an identifier must be
                        present. Another possible solution is to use in this case the element <gi>ptr</gi> instead
                           of <gi>ref</gi>. The element <ident>ptr</ident> is an empty element and all its information is encoded
                              with attributes. This means that we would have to omit, e.g., a bookbinder’s note,
                              yielding something like:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <date certainty="yes">1667<ptr target="note1"/>

      <head>Description of seals</head>
      <p>The description of seals attached to the manuscript follow the same model as
                  mentioned in the description of binding. The catalogue’s compiler could make a short
                  statement in form of paragraph or paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) or provide a structured description in the form of decoration description (<gi>decoNote</gi>), the condition of the seal(s)
                        (         <gi>condition</gi>) and the seal itself (<gi>seal</gi>). The element <gi>seal</gi> has the same special attribute <att>contemporary</att> with the same choice of values as @binding.

      <div>
         <head>General remarks
         </head>
         <p>There are several types of additional notes, some original to the manuscript, that
                     could be described in different ways. The first one, the colophon, containing the name
                     of the scribe, date and possibly place should be described as part of the <gi>msItemStruct</gi> as stated below. Other notes go elsewhere. Some examples follow.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <head>Description and edition of later note as part of the <gi>additions</gi> element
         </head>
         <p>This is the most obvious place for the description of additions. The element
            <gi>additions</gi> is the last part of the structure of <gi>physDesc</gi> element. If there is
                        just one addition, then the description and edition should be ordered in the following
                        order: locus, name, date The description could consist of one or more paragraphs or
                        it could be encoded as a list containing two or more items. If there is just one note, the structure could be as follows:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <additions type="inscription">
                  <p>
                     <locus>the place in the manuscript, e.g., f. 104r, inner margin</locus>
                     <persName>if available</persName>
                     <date>if available</date>
                     <quote>an edition of the original text</quote>
                     <note>other notes and/or bibliographic reference, e.g., previous
                                    editions and interpretations.</note>

            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>In cases with more than one note, it might be most convenient to represent them
                     as a list of separate items:

                     the marginal formula and some typologization about colophons (cf. Gagova 1998;

                     can make a simple reference in the element <gi>additions</gi>:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <additions>
                  <p>A separate folio 72 inserted during the early book re-binding in 16 c. now forms

               </additions>
            </egXML>

   <head>The Scribe: palaeography and features of the language</head>
   <div>
      <head>General remarks</head>
      <p>In the Repertorium Initiative approach all data about the palaeographic and linguistic aspects of the manuscripts are gathered together under the element <gi>scribeDesc</gi>. This element represents an information level between the pure physical
                     description of the manuscript and a description of its content. As elsewhere in this
                     electronic model, both unstructured and structured approaches are available. The unstructured description means entering the information only as part of paragraph (<gi>p</gi>)
                        elements. The structured approach involves encoding information about each scribe
                        (element <gi>scribe</gi>), possibly preceded by an overview (element <gi>summary</gi>). When
                           the second approach is adopted, the first elements to be entered are the name and the
                           place in the manuscript where the scribe has written it. If the name of the scribe is not
                           available or unknown, the encoder can record that as:
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <scribeDesc>
               <scribe n="1">
                  <name>anonymous</name>
                                    ...
               </scribe>
            </scribeDesc>
         </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>This information is followed by a description of palaeographic and linguistc features, along with additional notes as needed.
      </p>
      <list>
         <item>If there is more than one scribe, the <gi>scribe</gi> element must have an <att>n</att> attribute that assigns a sequential number to the scribe, so that, for example, the first scribe would be &lt;scribe n="1"&gt;. Scribes must be numbered with consecutive Arabic numerals (not letters), and if there is only one scribe, the <att>n</att> attribute must be omitted.
         </item>
         <item>When one and the same scribe wrote in several places in the manuscript, use a single <gi>scribe</gi> element that contains a <gi>locusGrp</gi> with several <gi>locus</gi> child elements.</item>
         <item>If the name of the scribe is unknown, write <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <name>anonymous</name>
         </egXML> (lower case). Do not write "unknown" or anything else other than "anonymous" as the value of the <gi>name</gi> element.</item>
   </list>
</div>
<div>
   <head>Palaeographical features</head>
   <p>The analysis of the palaeographical features of the manuscript should be accomplished in the element <gi>scriptDesc</gi>. The content of this element could be series of paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) or one or more <gi>scriptNote</gi>.
   </p>
   <p>A brief introduction to the palaeographical characteristics of the scribe can be included in the element <gi>summary</gi>, e.g.:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scriptDesc>
            <summary>Uncial script very close to the writing in Enina Apostle and Vatikana Palimpsest</summary>
                        ...
         </scriptDesc>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <p>Then the encoder can enter the element <gi>scriptNote</gi> which has several important attributes most used of them are <att>script</att> and <att>style</att>. The value of the <att>script</att> should be short code that is
                  compatible with international standards of script designations (ISO 15924), e.g.,<term> Grek</term>
                  for Greek, <term>Cyrl</term> for Modern Cyrillic, <term>Cyrs</term> for Old Cyrillic, <term>Latn</term> for Latin or <term>Glag</term> for
                  Glagolitic (<ref target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html">ISO 15924</ref>). Then the value of <att>style</att> could be some appropriate short values like <emph>uncial</emph> or <emph>semiunicial</emph> as in this example: 
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scriptNote script="Cyrs" style="uncial">...</scriptNote>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>The <att>script</att> attribute of element <gi>sctiptNote</gi> is obligatory.</item>
      <item>An optional <att>style</att> attribute can specify the subtype of the script, e.g., "semiuncial".</item>
      <item>If addition information is available about the writing, it must be specified in a <gi>scriptNote</gi> element as a plain text, e.g.:
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <scriptNnote script="Cyrs" style="semiuncial">
                        Semiuncial with with cursive elements.
            </scriptNnote>
         </egXML>
      </item>
   </list>
   <p>Do not use a <gi>p</gi> child element for simple descriptions that do not contain additional information. For example, do not write:</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <scriptNote script="Cyrs" type="semiuncial">
         <p>Semiuncial</p>
      </scriptNote>
   </egXML>
   <p>In some manuscripts could be observed that the scribe write in more than one manner. Than the <gi>scriptNote</gi> could be repeated with the locations of these styles: 
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scriptNote script="Cyrs" style="uncial">
            <locus>...</locus> ...
         </scriptNote>
         <scriptNote script="Cyrs" style="semiuncial">
            <locus>...</locus> ...
         </scriptNote>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <p>You could make an even more elaborated description of each letter or other signs in the scribe's writing by providing some characteristics in the form of list:</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <scriptNote script="Cyrs" style="semiuncial">
         <list>
            <item>The letter <foreign xml:lang="cu">a</foreign> is written ...</item>
            <item>The letter <foreign xml:lang="cu">б</foreign> is written ...</item>
         </list>
      </scriptNote>
   </egXML>
   <p>Usage examples within <gi>scriptNote</gi> must be tagged as <code>&lt;foreign xml:lang="cu"&gt;</code>. Here <gi>foreign</gi> means "belonging to some language other than that of the surrounding text" as formulated in TEI Guidelines (TEI). The elements <gi>w</gi>,      <gi>c</gi>,      <gi>seg</gi> are not to be used here.</p>
   <p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element and its children are to be used inside the <gi>scriptNote</gi> element only in situations where the responsibility belongs to the encoder (compiler) of the electronic description. They should be wrapped inside <gi>bibl</gi> element. For example:</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <bibl>
         <respStmt>
            <name ref="#AM">A. Miltenova</name>
            <resp>de visu</resp>
         </respStmt>
      </bibl>
   </egXML>
   <p>(Note that the name is not inverted.) In situations where the identification or description comes from a publication, though, instead of <gi>respStmt</gi> we must use a bibliographic pointer, e.g., instead of:</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <bibl>

      <head>General remarks</head>
      <p>In the framework of Repertorium Initiative there is a clear distinction between
                     the language of the <emph>text</emph> and the language of the <emph>scribe</emph>. The language of the text is understood in relation to the text history, cf. the section pertaining to manuscript content.
                     The language of the scribe or scribes may or may not be related with the text history
                     and text analysis. Therefore, a special section in the manuscript description is need to
                     allow it to be treated separately from the language of the text (element <gi>textLang</gi>, see <ref target="#text_lang">The language of the text</ref> below).
      </p>
      <p>The language of the scribe can be described as unstructured paragraphs:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scribeLang>
            <p> ... </p>
         </scribeLang>
      </egXML>
      <p>However, if the encoder would like to enter just brief information about language it is better to use once an element <gi>summary</gi>:
      </p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scribeLang>
            <summary>Tŭrnovo school orthography.</summary>
         </scribeLang>
      </egXML>
      <p>You could combine then this brief introduction with more elaborated description of each language feature inside the element <gi>langNote</gi>: 
      </p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <scribeLang>
            <summary> ... </summary>

      </egXML>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>Levels of Language Representation</head>
      <p>It is possible to encode different levels of scribal language – from orthography to syntax and lexis with the help of the element <gi>langNote</gi>. This element has several special attributes which can help to classify various aspects of linguistics features:</p>
      <list>
         <item>
            <att>key</att> can be used to distinguish between various language levels: orthography, phonology, morphology, syntax or lexicon;</item>
         <item>
            <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> could be used to make a further typologization of the subject;</item>
         <item>
            <att>datcat</att> could provide a pointer to a definition of the language level or feature.</item>
      </list>
      <p>The <att>datcat</att> should point to registry of linguistic terminology, as for example to <ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/content/clarin-concept-registry">CLARIN Concept Registry</ref>. There are short definitions of terms along with their place among the metadata for linguistic features. In this way the <code>@key="orthography"</code> could be accompanied with the pointer to concept registry, e.g.:</p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <langNote key="orthography" datcat="http://hdl.handle.net/11459/CCR_C-2971_fff56172-59bd-da09-4140-765fa82b5494">
                        ... 
         </langNote>
      </egXML>
      <p>For morpho-syntactic features you can use concepts of Universal dependency theory, especially <ref target="https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/cu_proiel/index.html">UD Old Church Slavonic PROIEL</ref> (         <ref target="#Eckhoff2015">Eckhoff and Berdičevskis 2015</ref>). See also <ref target="#key_2_Clarin">Possible mappings of <att>key</att> attribute values to CLARIN Concept Registry</ref>
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <head>Orthography</head>
   <p>Encoders of Slavonic manuscripts have two possible ways to describe orthographic features. The first is to provide only a brief characteristic, e.g.:</p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <langNote key="orthography">The scribe writes with two jers and with nonetymological appearance of juses. After
                              the letters ш, ж, in the word-initial position (after j), and after the vowel letters front nasal is
                              turned into the back one. After ч this change is not observed. A relatively small number of liga-
                              tures and supralinear signs. 
      </langNote>
   </egXML>
   <p>The other way to describe the orthography of the scribe is to use <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes as part of the element <gi>langNote</gi>. These attributes are
                     used to typologize the orthography of the scribe in appropriate ways, especially with
                     respect to three groups of letters: jers, juses and letters for jotated vowels.
   </p>
   <div>
      <head>The orthography of the jers</head>
      <p>Information regarding this feature is entered in the element <gi>orthNote</gi> with
                           value of attribute <code>@type="jer"</code>. The encoder can describe the positions of jers and
                           their relationship to the etymological condition, along with examples of their usage.
      </p>
      <p>This element could have one additional attribute: <att>subtype</att>. Possible values are:
      </p>
      <list>
         <item>
            <emph>front</emph>: only front jer is used;</item>
         <item>
            <emph>back</emph>: only back jer is used;</item>
         <item>
            <emph>etymReg</emph>: etymologically regular use of jers;</item>
         <item>
            <emph>nonEtymReg</emph>: not etymological but regular use of jers;</item>
         <item>
            <emph>irregular</emph>: the use of jers cannot be formalized in general rules.</item>
      </list>
      <p>For example, manuscripts written with Tărnovo orthographic norms use both jers
                           regularly, but in a non-etymological way. The same is true for the Zograph Folia from
                           the tenth century.
         <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <langNote key="orthography" type="jer" subtype="nonEtymReg">Both jers are used but
                                    jery is written only with front jer. There is a tendency to substitute back with front jer before
                                    a syllable with front vowel.</langNote>
         </egXML>
      </p>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>The orthography of the juses</head>
      <p>The description of the orthography of the juses is very similar to that of jers, addressing the positions where juses are or are not used, etymologically correct or incor-
                           rect usage, etc. The element <gi>langNote</gi> is used here, too, but with <code>type="jus"</code>.
                           Here, the possible values of <att>subtype</att> attribute are:
      </p>
      <list>
         <item>etymReg: etymologically regular use of juses (e.g., as in Old Bulgarian);</item>
         <item>nonEtymReg: non etymological, but otherwise regular use of the juses (Middle Bul-
                              garian manuscripts, and in part East Slavic examples);</item>
         <item>nonConsis: nonconsistent use of the juses; </item>
         <item>nonJus: orthography without juses;</item>
         <item>jusTrace: orthography without or with very few examples of the juses, but with traces, e.g., manuscripts written generally with non-jus orthography but with traces of the Middle Bulgarian alternation of juses.
         </item>
      </list>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <langNote key="orthography" type="jus" subtype="jusTrace">The text is written with non-jus
                                 orthography but with some traces of Middle Bulgarian confusion of
                                 nasals.</langNote>
      </egXML>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>The orthography of the letters for jotated vowels</head>
      <p>In many cases the distribution of jers and juses may provide enough data to
                           determine the main features of a specific medieval Slavic orthographic system. To
                           be more precise, however, the description of letters for jotated vowels may also be
                           important. This information is also as part with the element <gi>langNote</gi> with the
                           value of <code>type="jotVowel"</code>.
      </p>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <langNote key="orthography" type="jotVowel">The letters <c xml:id="cu">є</c> and
            <c xml:id="cu">ѥ</c> are both used in intervocalic position.</langNote>
      </egXML>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>The orthography of other letters or signs</head>
      <p>The distribution of all other letters and special signs with the exception of musical notation and cryptographic systems follow the model as described here for jotated
                           vowels. The same model could be used for the description of non-Slavic orthographic features, as well.
      </p>
   </div>
</div>
<div>
   <head>Description of grammatical features</head>
   <p>The description of grammatical characteristics could be divided into separate
                     units, but in this case, unlike with orthography, there may not be a standard list of descriptive criteria, and the researcher has to introduce the structure using the available
                     means. Consider the following example: </p>
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <langNote key="phonology">Adjective forms prefer the archaic <m xml:lang="cu">-сц-</m> to <m xml:lang="cu">-ст-</m>. Cases with
         <m xml:lang="cu">-ст-</m> are rare. Uncontracted forms of pronominal
                                    adjectives and of verbs of the -je-conjugation in Ind. Praes. Act. and of verbs in
                                    Imperfect are much more frequent than contracted ones. Verbal forms(Ind. Praes. Act.,
                                    p.3, -je-conjugation) with assimilation, such as <w xml:lang="cu">бѣгаат</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">радоуоутъ</w> are frequent. In Imperativus there
                                       is variation of forms with <c xml:lang="cu">ѣ</c> and with <c xml:lang="cu">и</c>, such as <w xml:lang="cu">покажѣте</w> 290.17, but
                                          also <w lang="cu">покажите</w>
                                             80.5.</langNote>
      <langNote key="verbs">The manuscript uses non-sigmatic
                                 Aoristus (e.g., <w xml:lang="cu">вьнидъ</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">сънидъ </w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">идомъ</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">отидѫ</w>)and first sigmatic Aoristus of verbs with stems
                                 ending in a consonant (e.g., <w xml:lang="cu">привѣс</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">въвѣсом</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">възнѣсѧ </w>). Verbs
                                 with infinitive stems ending in a vowel often preserve the archaic ending <m xml:lang="cu">-тъ</m> in Ind. Aor. Act, p. 2 and 3, Sg., e.g., <w xml:lang="cu">обитъ</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">оумрѣт</w>. Three cases of
                                    omitted ending <m xml:lang="cu">-тъ</m> for Ind. Praes. Act., p. 3. Sg. are
                                       found (<w xml:lang="cu">e</w> instead of <w xml:lang="cu">естъ</w>,         <w xml:lang="cu">нѣ</w> for <w xml:lang="cu">нѣст</w>,
                                          and <w xml:lang="cu">бѫд</w> for <w xml:lang="cu">bѫдет</w>).

                                    In other forms <m xml:lang="cu">-ье</m> is preferred (cf. <w xml:lang="cu">абье</w>, 24r.20).

<div>
   <head>Description of lexical features</head>
   <p>Lexical features can be described similarly to grammatical ones. Whether this
                     takes the form of a list with items or of just one unit depends on the encoder’s vision
                     and the length of the material:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <langNote key="lexicon">The manuscript uses lexis that is believed to be typical of the earli-
                           est Gospel translation from Greek, cf. the use of the archaic lexemes <foreign xml:lang="cu">баль, жаль, миса, шюи, братръ, небесьскъ, неприѣзнь, пропѧти,
                              иночѧдъ, врътъ, искрьнъ, грѣсти</foreign>could prove this hypothesis. Also,
                              in word-formation the manuscript prefers the old suffix <m xml:lang="cu" type="suffix">ице ѫ</m> and not
            <m xml:lang="cu" type="suffix">ждь</m>. Still, the following forms
                                    are considered to be relatively later: <foreign xml:lang="cu">благодать,

<head>The manuscript contents</head>
<p>The description of the manuscript contents in the Repertorium electronic de-
               scription model is distributed over two main parts, one pertaining to the manuscript as
               a single body of texts and the other to each text individually.
</p>
<div>
<head>The content of the whole manuscript</head>
<p>The content of the whole manuscript is described in the element <gi>msContents</gi>.
                  Nothing in this element is mandatory, but the element itself is required, and the encod-
                  er might start by defining the range of texts in terms of the research tradition. There
                  are three special attributes for this element. The first, <att>type</att>, can record whether
                  the manuscript collection of texts is original (original) or represents either an earlier
                  compilation or a translation. The second, <att>style</att>, can situate the manuscript within
                  a broad typology, viz., choosing between the values narrative and non-narrative. The
                  third, <att>class</att>, can be used to provide a convenient typology for all the texts in the
                  manuscript. The usage of these three attributes with their values can be illustrated with
                  this example:
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <msContents class="vitas" type="translation" style="narrative">
                        ...					
      </msContents>
   </egXML>
</p>
<p>Here the basic information about all the texts in the manuscript is given. In this
                  case, the main classification of the texts falls under the category of <term>Vitas of saints</term> that
                  are translations and that are narrative.

                        information:

   <head xml:id="author_mss">The authors, editors and compilers of the text collection
                  in the manuscript
   </head>
   <p>In most cases manuscripts contain texts from different authors and their tradition
                     of edition and compilation could be very variable. There are, however, also codices
                     that contain more or less a fixed collection of texts by or attributed to a single author.
                     In such cases, such as the <emph>Pandects of Antiochus</emph>,      <emph>Pandects of Nikon of Montenegro</emph> or
      <emph>Chrysorrhoas</emph> collection with writings of John Chrysostom (Thomson 1982; Miltenov
                     2010; Милтенов 2011) we can provide information about the author and sometimes
                     about the editor/compiler of the whole set of texts, as in this example:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <author>John Chrysostom</author>
         <respStmt>
            <resp>Translator</resp>

      </cit>
   </p>
   <p>Here we have three kinds of information: 1) about the original author of the
                     texts (John Chrysostom), 2) about the translator of his works (monk Antonij), and
                     3) about the compiler of this miscellany (Vladislav Gramatik). All the information
                     other than authorship is contained in the element <gi>respStmt</gi>, which has two parts:
      <gi>resp</gi> (responsibility), here a brief statement in the form of words as editor, compi­
                           ler, scribe etc., could be made and information about the person in elements <gi>name</gi>
                              or <gi>persName</gi> (personal name, cf. Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: <code>respStmt</code>).

   <head>A note in the description of texts
   </head>
   <p>The element <gi>note</gi> in the description of texts is restricted to cases that deal
                     with extra-textual historical features, such as missing parts of the texts:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <note>Most of the texts have some missing parts. Cf.
                           Manuscript Condition </note>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <p>Here, a reference to the physical condition of the manuscript is given. In other
                     cases the element <gi>note</gi> could be useful to further refine the text attribution of the
                        whole codex and/or to provide bibliographic data:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

      </egXML>
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <head>Information about text history for the whole manuscript
   </head>
   <p>The text historical information on the level of the whole manuscripts is part of
                     the content of the series of element <gi>filiation</gi>. This element has one important at-
                        tribute, <att>type</att>, the most common values of which are :
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>antigraph: information about the text collection’s antigraph;</item>
      <item>apograph: information about the text collection’s apograph; </item>
      <item>litRedaction: information about the textual redaction or recension of the whole manu-
                        script; </item>
      <item>protograph: information about the text collection’s protograph; </item>
      <item>source: the source of the whole text collection; </item>
      <item> translation: data about the translation with respect to number and/or origin.</item>
   </list>
   <p>Examples of usage are given below. On the level of the whole manuscript these
                     features are invoked only when conclusions can be drawn for the whole text collection
                     about a common source, protograph, literary redaction, etc.
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <head>The original text on the level of the whole manuscript
   </head>
   <p>Some collections of texts have a common title or heading, incipit and explicit. In
                     this cases, the element <gi>sampleText</gi> could be used. In all other cases the element
      <gi>sampleText</gi> should be used to illustrate particular texts from the manuscripts,
                           rather than the whole body of the codex.
   </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<head>The characterization of each text
</head>
<p>Information about each individual text resembles closely the description of the
                  whole text collection. All features of such a description are given as part of the element <gi>msItemStruct</gi> (a structured manuscript item, Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:
   <code>msItemStruct</code>). This element has the same three attributes, with the same functions,
                     as <gi>msContents</gi>:   <att>type</att>,   <att>style</att> and <att>class</att>. In addition to these attributes it
                        may be convenient to use unique identifier for each text as part of the XML document
                        (attribute <att>xml:id</att>), as well as perhaps <att>defective</att> with one of the values: <emph>true</emph>,
   <emph>false</emph>,   <emph>unknown</emph>,   <emph>inapplicable</emph>. In the Repertorium framework the value of the <att>xml:id</att> in <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is a combination of the fixed string ACD (abbreviation for
   <emph>Article Content Description</emph>) and the place number of the text in order in the manu-
                           script. A combination of all of the important attributes of <gi>msItemStruct</gi> can be
                              illustrated by this hypothetical example:
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <msItemStruct defective="true" type="compilation" style="non-narrative" xml:id="ACD1">
                     ...
      </msItemStruct>
   </egXML>
</p>
<div>
   <head>The text location</head>
   <p>The exact place of the text occurs in the manuscript is given as part of the ele-
                     ment <gi>locus</gi>. In the Repertorium we use this element together with the attribute <att>n</att>
                        (number) to represent the number of a text as part of a whole text collection:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <locus n="1">1r-25v</locus>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <p>The contents of the element here is the exact ordinal location in the manuscript
                     where the text is to be found.
   </p>
   <p>When the one and same text is dispersed across different parts of manuscript a
      <gi>locusGrp</gi> element is used:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <locusGrp n="7">
            <locus n="7.1">154r-155v</locus>
            <locus n="7.2">90r-90v</locus>
         </locusGrp>
      </egXML>
      <cit>
         <bibl>From the electronic description of MS NBKM 309
                        by Anissava Miltenova
         </bibl>
      </cit>
   </p>
   <p>In this example the text is falsely reordered in two different places in the manuscript, so that the beginning part of the text is bound later than the ending part. In such
                     cases it is mandatory to give the exact order of the leaves. The attribute <att>n</att> gives here
                     the exact number of the text (7), which is restored to logical order with the help of
                     sub-numbers (7.1 and 7.2).
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <head>The name of the text given by the researcher
   </head>
   <p>In the approach of Repertorium Initiative, there is a strict distinction between
                     text supplied by the researcher (the so-called “scientific title") and the original title of
                     a text as it appears in the manuscript copy. Both are important, the original text be-
                     cause it is part of the archaeographic object and the scientific title because it enables
                     researchers to identify and attribute texts consistently, even when the titles may be
                     spelled differently in different manuscripts.
   </p>
   <p>Consider the following example:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
         <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD6" style="narrative" type="translation">
            <locus n="6">200r-203v</locus>
            <title lang="en">Interpretation of the Acts of Apostles. </title>
            <author>St. Hyppolitus of Rome. </author>
            <note>Interpretation on the 9th Proverb: “Wisdom has built her house".</note>
            <filiation type="source" subtype="Greek">
               <bibl>Migne, PG 10,
                                    col. 952-953</bibl>
            </filiation>
            <filiation type="translation">
               <num>1?</num>
            </filiation>
            <filiation type="protograph">Bulgarian</filiation>
                                       ...
         </msItemStruct>
      </egXML>
   </p>
   <p>If the title were just transferred automatically from the original text of the manu-
                     script, the text would read “About the 12 Apostles. Where each of them preached".
                     Such a title would not make it possible to identify other copies of the same text, where
                     the heading in those other manuscripts will probably be different, and it would also
                     not be possible to compare this text with its Greek source. In this case the element
      <gi>title</gi> should provide a standardized title that is compatible with other Slavonic
                        and non-Slavonic traditions.
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <head xml:id="author_text">The author of the text</head>
   <p>The author of the text is given as content of the element <gi>author</gi>. This element
                     contains the name of the author of the text as attributed by the encoder, and it may not
                     agree with the name of an alleged author included in the manuscript itself. The usage
                     of this element and as well as the element <gi>respStmt</gi> is exactly as the illustrated as
                     part of the element <ref target="#author_mss">

   <gi>note</gi> inside <ident>msItemStruct</ident>. In the example given above, the content of this
                        element is:

      <note>Interpretation on the 9th Proverb: “Wisdom has
                              built her house"</note>
   </egXML>
</p>
<p>In this example, the element’s content explains the title given by the researcher.
                     Without the knowledge that this fragment is part of a larger text, which has its own
                     tradition, it would be impossible to undertake further steps in the investigation. This
                     element may also be used to explain text losses and interpolations, which may provide
                     keys to understanding the textual tradition.

<p>Here we have all possible information about this date in the Codex Supraliensis.
                     The commemoration of St. John the Hesychast in this manuscript is on March 31,
                     formalized as 03-31. The date is used in the church calendar (<code>type="church"</code>), is
                     presented in the manuscript (<emph>internal</emph>, i.e., not supplied or conjectured by the encoder) and is part of the <emph>fixed</emph> (non-movable) feast days.

<div>
<head xml:id="text_lang">The language of the text</head>
<p>Unlike the element <gi>scribeLang</gi>, which is intended to give information about
                     the language of the scribe and of the manuscript parts, <gi>textLang</gi> element can provide
                        material for the linguistic analysis of the textological features of a particular text.
                        Consider the example:
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <textLang>Only in this text we could find
                              the older forms of the stemmatic
                              Aoristus ... </textLang>
   </egXML>
</p>
<p>This observation could lead to closer comparison of this text with other parts of
                     the contents, and may help determine whether its origin is different from theirs (cf.  <ref target="#scribe_lang">Description of the scribe’s language</ref> above).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>The text source</head>
<p>Usually the source in the Slavonic tradition is a Greek or Latin original text that
                     served as the source of translation. In the example above the excerpt:
   <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <filiation type="source" subtype="Greek">
         <bibl>Migne, PG 10,
                           col. 952-953</bibl>
      </filiation>
   </egXML>
                     means not that the given text is a direct source for the translation, but that it is
                     cited as a parallel to the Slavic text in the described manuscript.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>The text translation
</head>
<p>If the text is translated from other sources, then in the element <gi>filiation</gi> with
                     the <code>type="translation"</code> the encoder may enter information about the translation,
                     e.g., the number of the translation and the place. A question mark can be used to indicate uncertainty, e.g.:

<p>As with the description of the whole manuscript content, at least four values
                     could be given for <att>type</att> in the element <gi>filiation</gi>:   <term>protograph</term>,   <term>antigraph</term>,   <term>apograph</term>, and <term>litRedaction</term>. These elements can provide a context for researching the
                        transmission of the text by situating it within the larger tradition.

      <filiation type="litRedaction">The manuscript uses archaic lexis and
                              is considered to belong to the archaic group of Apostoloi representing the Cyrillo-

<head>The text location and textual criticism
</head>
<p>A comparison of different copies of one and the same text may lead to interesting results. For example MS NBKM 309 and MS Slav. Dujčev 17 share almost the
                     same content, the latter manuscript being the copy of the former. During restoration
                     the content of the MS NBKM 309 was rearranged, leading to disordered folia. As a result the content of both is now best described by comparison (Милтенова 1989). In
                     the process of electronic cataloguing the contents of the both manuscripts have been
                     reconstructed as part of the process of identifying a possible common ancestor. In
                     electronic form this task could be fulfilled by attribute values in elements <gi>msItemStruct</gi> and <gi>locus</gi>. In both manuscript descriptions <att>xml:id</att> begins with value
                           ACD1. However, the values of the attribute <att>n</att> on the element <gi>locus</gi> differ. The
                              first text in MS NBKM 309 is:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
   <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD1" type="translation">
      <locus n="3">109r-110r</locus>
      <title>Calendologion</title>
                                       ...
   </msItemStruct>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The same text in the description of Slav Dujčev 17 has the same number in <gi>locus</gi> but comes in the second place:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
   <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD2" type="translation">
      <locus n="3">3v-6v</locus>
      <title>Calendologion</title>
                              ...
   </msItemStruct>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>One text is missing in MS NBKM 309 but it is present in Dujčev 17, where it
                     bears a designation number 2:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
   <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD1" type="translation">
      <locus n="2">2r-3v</locus>
      <title xml:lang="bg">Thunder book according to ascending and descending
                                 moon</title>

</cit>
</p>
<p>In both manuscripts the first item from the reconstructed cycle is missing, and
                     therefore an element <gi>locus</gi> with <code>n="1"</code> is absent as well.
</p>
<p>Thus, we can have three different points of view about the place of a particular
                     text: 1) as part of the manuscript; 2) as part of the content shared with another manu-
                     script, and 3) as part of the reconstructed cycle of texts.

<head>Decorations for a particular text
</head>
<p>In principle decorations should be described as part of <gi>physDesc</gi>. In some
                     cases, however, parts of the cataloguing could be entered as the element <gi>decoDesc</gi>
                        and with the same XML content as <ident>msItemStruct</ident>. This could be especially convenient in cases when the manuscript copy is compared with other copies of the same
                           text, which could lead to conclusions about specific text formation and layout.

<head>Description and edition of the colophon
</head>
<p>Unlike later or non-genuine inscriptions and notes, a colophon is considered part
                     of the genuine content of the manuscript. As such it is part of the <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
                        element and its description shares the same features as other text. The only exception
                        to this rule is that the text of the colophon is entered as a special element <gi>colophon</gi>:

<head>Description of texts with complicated structure

<p>There are many texts in the medieval tradition that are composed, in turn, from
                     other texts or text parts, and the Repertorium model, building on TEI, provides a
                     method for describing such texts as part of the larger ones. This task could be accomplished by nesting <gi>msItemStruct</gi> inside another <ident>msItemStruct</ident> element:

<p>In this example the main text is called „Physiologus" and it contains more than
                     40 small stories. The first one is „About the lion". The numbers and identifiers are set
                     in such a way that it is possible from their value to see the text hierarchy (cf. values
                     ACD15 and ACD15.1). Every text could have its own standardized title, as given by
                     the research tradition, along with its own incipit and/or explicit, as found in the manuscript (cf. also Стойкова 2011).

<p>The Repertorium uses a special element <gi>sampleText</gi> as a wrapper around
                     several elements used for the identification of text items in a manuscript. Its function
                     is to make a distinction between the language of the description (metadata used to
                     describe the manuscript) and the original text. The element itself uses one global TEI
                     attribute, <att>xml:lang</att>, which represents the language of the content, and for medieval
                     Slavonic codices its value is almost always cu. The optional attribute <att>script</att> commonly contains the value <emph>Cyrs</emph> (for old Cyrillic) or <emph>Glag</emph> (for Glagolitic).

                     could serve as a preliminary publication. In such cases an element <gi>div</gi> (division,
<ref target="#TEI">TEI Consortium</ref>:<ref target="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-div.html">div</ref>) should be used with an appropriate value in the at-

<head>The history of the manuscript
</head>
<div>
<head>General remarks
</head>
<p>The location of the manuscript date and place differs across descriptive mod-
                  els. The deviations are caused not by the particular research culture (e.g., Byzantine
                  Greek, Slavonic, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, or Hebrew), but, rather, by the more
                  general assumptions of local traditions. Very often the date of a manuscript is repre-
                  sented as part of the heading of the description, together with the place of origin and
                  its name. In the Repertorium framework historical information about a manuscript is
                  unified within the element <gi>history</gi>.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>Date and place of origin of the manuscript
</head>
<p>This element could contain a short overview of the history of the manuscript in
                  the form of one or more paragaraphs (element <gi>p</gi>) or it could contain a structured
                     description of its origin, provenance and acquisition in a library or archive, possibly
                     introduced by some kind of summary (element <gi>summary</gi>). The orginal date and
                        place of the manuscript are containing in the element <gi>origin</gi>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</p>
<p>In this example the elements <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> both have attributes <att>evidence</att> and <att>cert</att> (certainty). The value <emph>internal</emph> means that the we
                  know from the manuscript about the date and place of origin. Additionally we can
                  provide the attribute <att>cert</att> with a value such as, for example, <emph>high</emph>, which means that
                  we believe that the data in manuscript is the true one. Other possible values of <att>cert</att>
                  are <emph>low</emph>,<emph>medium</emph> or <emph>unknown</emph>.

<item>facts about copies of the manuscript;</item>
<item>a bibliographic list of known publications of or about the manuscript.</item>
</list>
<div>
<head>Administrative information</head>
<p>The administrative information in this model consists of a recording of changes
                  in the electronic description (<gi>recordHist</gi>), a statement of the manuscript’s availability (<gi>availability</gi>), a sketch of custodial events (<gi>custodialHist</gi>), and
                        optional extra or complementary data (<gi>note</gi>).
</p>
<div>
<head>Recording the history of the electronic description
</head>
<p>The element <gi>recordHist</gi> can be used to document all changes in the elec-
                     tronic description. In this element, as elsewhere in the TEI, the encoder has two ways
                     to submit data – as one or more paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) or as a sequence of specialized
                        elements, which in this case are <gi>source</gi> and <gi>change</gi>. The <gi>source</gi> is not
                           repeatable, but because there could be many changes in the electronic description,
<gi>change</gi> is optional and repeatable.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</div>
<div>
<head>Availability of the manuscript</head>
<p>Unlike the element <gi>availability</gi> as part of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> (cf. <ref target="#publication_stmt">below</ref>), the appearance of this element in the context of administrative information refers to the
                     availability of the manuscript itself. In most of the cases access to the archival collection is restricted, which is reflected in an entry like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<availability>
<p>Restricted. Used by permission and by appointment with the curator</p>
</availability>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The encoder might wish to consult the archive itself for the appropriate formulation of rules for access to the manuscript.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>Custodial facts</head>
<p>Here too, the encoder has two ways to submit data – as one or more paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) or as one or more <gi>custEvent</gi> (custodial event, <ref target="#TEI">TEI Consortium</ref>) elements. This element might include facts about restoration, conservation of the manuscript, participation in exhibitions, etc., e.g.:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<custodialHist>
<custEvent type="exhibition" from="2011-05-11" to="2011-06-11">Part of the exhibition “Slavic Manuscripts from the Historical Museum in Kjustendil"</custEvent>
</custodialHist>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Every event in the history of the manuscript can be encoded as a separate
<gi>custEvent</gi> element containing the attribute <att>type</att>, which further speci-
                        fies its kind. The attributes <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> give information about the date
                        span.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>The note in the administrative information
</head>
<p>Other data that cannot be formalized in advance could become part of the ele-
                     ment <gi>note</gi> as part of the administrative information (<gi>adminInfo</gi>).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<head>Copies of the manuscript</head>
<p>Information about various known copies of the manuscript and their characteristics are encoded as part of the element <gi>surrogates</gi>. Consider the
                     following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</list>
</p>
</surrogates>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Some manuscript may have multiple copies. This information is recorded as a
                  list of items, each of which has information about the place in the manuscript the picture is taken from and identifying information about the file and its name.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head xml:id="bibl_list">A bibliographical list</head>
<p>The last item in the electronic manuscript description is a compiled bibliographic
                  list of references. This reference list should include only publications about the described manuscript, such as earlier descriptions or editions or special research related
                  to the palaeographic, codicological, text historical or linguistic features of the manuscript. All other types of bibliographic references should be mentioned in the appropriate places in the description.

<div>
<head>General remarks</head>
<p>The element <gi>msPart</gi> (i.e. manuscript part) should be used in the cases when
               the manuscript is a) a convolute; b) a palimpsest, c) a supplemental physically different part in the manuscript or a d) supplemental and additionally written literary part of
               the manuscript. Several cases can be distinguished:
<list>
<item> When the codex is re-bound and later end leaves and paste-downs are inserted by the
                     rebinding process this information should be entered in the corresponding sections of the element <gi>binding</gi>;
</item>
<item>The same is true in cases when the parchment or paper is reinforced as part of the re-
                     binding process; </item>
<item>However, when a later leaf or leaves is inserted in order to supplement the text and
                     this part is obviously different, the element <gi>msPart</gi> should be used to describe the codicological, palaeographic, language and text features of this inserted part.
</item>
<item>The element <gi>msPart</gi> is not used to distinguish parts of the text written by the particular
                     scribes. This information is part of the element scribe and its sub-elements.
</item>
<item>The element <gi>msPart</gi> is not used when the manuscript is now kept in various repositories or in one repository under different shelfmarks. This information is entered in element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and its sub-element <gi>altIdentifier</gi>.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The element <gi>msPart</gi> consists of the same elements for identification and the
               description of physical features, language, palaeography and text as mentioned above
               for an entire manuscript.
</p>
<p>The identification part has several variants:</p>
<list>
<!-- msPart can not contain msIdentifier just altIdentifier:
               <item>With the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> – usage should be restricted to cases
                  where the physically different part of the manuscript is kept in another repository or
                  within the same repository but under a different shelfmark.
               </item>
               -->
<item>With the element <gi>altIdentifier</gi> – it could be used to mention a special
                  name of the manuscript part, e.g., in the case of palimpsests.
</item>
<item> The most obvious and convenient way to describe physically distinct part of
                  the manuscript is to use the elements <gi>locus</gi> or <gi>locusGrp</gi>.

<p>Somewhere at the beginning of the physical description should be a short statement about the fact that the manuscript in question is a palimpsest. Sections about
                  manuscript cataloguing, history, etc. are almost always common for all data with one
                  exception: the original dates of writing and places of origin differ, and this information should be provided explicitly. In cases involving restoration and references there
                  could be a need for additional data sets. Parts are further specified with the help of <att>type</att>.

<p>From the point of view of electronic encoding there is not much difference between palimpsests and convolutes, even though, unlike palimpsests, convolutes can
                  be formed from paper and are defined not in terms of layers, but as a horizontal sequence of parts.

<p>In principle, convolutes do not require special manuscript names or shelfmarks.
                  They do, however, require a special section pointing to the place(s) where the parts are
                  to be found. In the example above the element <gi>locus</gi> fulfills this role.

<head>Description of additional folia or parts of the manuscripts</head>
<p>The use of the <gi>msPart</gi> element might be appropriate when there are addi-
                  tional parts in the manuscript that are not to be considered as convoluted, or do not
                  form a part of binding (paste-downs or end-leaves), and which might intersect with
                  the provenance of the manuscript. Such parts should be described as separate element
<gi>msPart</gi> with the value of the attribute <att>type</att>
<emph>additional</emph>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>Examples of such usage could include an additional note on a separate leaf, or
                  text from a later scribe.

</div>
<div>
<head>Additionally written part(s) of a manuscript</head>
<p> A special case could be a separate text written on the same folia as the original
               manuscript but containing an entire separate literary work. This addition is best de-
               scribed inside a special <gi>msPart</gi> element with its own location, name of the scribe,
                  if available, and, of course, with a description of the content. Very often these texts
                  are unique in the tradition and they deserve a special edition inside the description. In
                  such cases an element <gi>div</gi> with its sub-elements should be provided:

<head>A complicated example: a palimpsest kept in various repositories</head>
<p>One particularly complicated case for description is a Sinai Slavic Miscellany
               that now is kept in two libraries, where it is divided into 5 parts. The manuscript, written on parchment and paper, has palimpsest parts in Cyrillic, Glagolitic and Greek.
               The description begins with the heading:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>Then come physical characteristics like number of leaves, dimensions, and layout characteristics that do not belong to one particular part, followed by a general
               overview about the manuscript condition. After this follow the characteristics of all 7
               scribes who wrote the upper layer of the text. Consider the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</p>
<p>Here the place where scribe 5 wrote is identified and attributed, followed
               by a short overview of his palaeography and language.
</p>
<p>A description of the content applies to all parts together, and begins with
               general information about the origins of all of the texts:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                           ...
</msContents>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Since the texts now are in different repositories, their sequence and locations are
            especially important. Consider the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItemStruct xml:id="ACD1">
<locusGrp>
   <locus n="Sin.18N.1">Sin. 18/N, 1v–8v</locus>

                           58, 55, 56, 61–98)</locus>

<author xml:lang="la">Nicon monachus</author>
                        ...
</msItemStruct>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The cataloguing information of the common part ends with data about the manuscript’s origin, history and administrative information. Then begins a description of
               each of the palimpsest’s parts, for example:

<head xml:id="lost_mss">
<note place="inline">Added: </note>Lost or destroyed manuscripts</head>
<p>Manuscripts that have been lost or destroyed must normally contain the same full <gi>msIdentifier</gi> elements as extant manuscripts, including <gi>country</gi>,<gi>settlement</gi>,<gi>repository</gi>, and <gi>idno</gi>. The information that a manuscript has been lost may be encoded outside the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element in two places that are part of the standard TEI manuscript description module, as follows:</p>
<p>
<code>msDesc/additional/adminInfo/availability/p</code> This element is required for lost or destroyed manuscripts. When reports are generated that include information drawn from the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> section of the description, the contents of this <gi>availability</gi> element will be rendered in parentheses next to that information. The encoding must therefore contain the text exactly as it should appear in the final-form output. For lost manuscripts, we recommend the string "lost" (lower-case, no punctuation, no spaces), but encoders may use any string they consider appropriate. For example, in the case of the Apocryphal Miscellany NB Belgrade, 305, which was destroyed in the 1941 German bombing of Belgrade, this entry would read:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<availability>
<p>lost</p>
</availability>
</egXML>
<p>When generating a list of manuscripts in the corpus, this entry will be rendered as "Serbia, Belgrade, National Library, 305 (lost)". </p>
<p>
<note place="inline"></note> For the usage of element <gi>availability</gi> for the electronic document see <ref target="#publication_stmt">Information on document publication</ref>.
</p>
<p>msDesc/history/summary This element is optional, and it contains a longer prose description of the circumstances surrounding the loss or destruction of the manuscript. The contents of this element will be rendered as a paragraph when a full manuscript description is generated for output, and encoders must therefore enter the text as they would like it to appear. In the case of the Apocryphal Miscellany NB Belgrade, 305, mentioned above, this entry would read:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<history>
<summary>Lost in the destruction of the National Library of Serbia during the German bombing in April 1941.</summary>
</history>
</egXML>
<p>When generating a reading view of this manuscript description, the contents of the history element will be rendered as "Lost in the destruction of the National Library of Serbia during the German bombing in April 1941."</p>

<head xml:id="usageCommon">Usage of some elements common with TEI P5 declarations</head>

<div>
<head xml:id="bibl">Bibliographies and references</head>
<p>Bibliographies provide a choice between one simple bibliographical reference
                  (element <gi>bibl</gi>) and a list of such references (element <gi>listBibl</gi>). Both elements are described in TEI Guidelines (<ref target="#TEI">TEI Consortium</ref>). In the Repertorium
                  framework neither of these should contain a full bibliographical record; Repertorium
                  practice is that these elements contain only pointers to full bibliographic information,
                  which is encoded at the end of a description or, when the description is part of the
                  larger project, in а separate file.
</p>
<p>
<note place="inline">Added: </note>
                  The TEI does not permit bibliographic references under <gi>sourceDesc</gi> to be expressed as a <gi>ref</gi> child of <gi>sourceDesc</gi>, and the same is true of bibliographic references inside the Repertorium <gi>scribe</gi> element. Instead, the <gi>ref</gi> must be wrapped in a <gi>bibl</gi> element. For example, instead of:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<ref type="bibl" target="bib:Милтенова1986c">Милтенова 1986: 114-125</ref>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>the markup must read:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<bibl>
<ref target="bib:Милтенова1986c">Милтенова 1986: 114-125</ref>
</bibl>
</egXML>
<p>Note that when the <gi>ref</gi> is a child of <gi>bibl</gi>, we remove the <att>type</att>="bibl" attribute specification.</p>
<p>
<note place="inline">Added: </note> See also <ref target="#bibl_list">A bibliographical list</ref>;<ref target="#bibl_msItem">Bibliographic references in <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
</ref>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>
<note place="inline">Added: </note>Certainty</head>
<p>If we are uncertain about a proposed scientific title for an <gi>msItemStruct</gi>, we include an empty <gi>certainty</gi> element after the title, just before the &lt;/title&gt; end tag, with a <att>locus</att> equal to "value" (that is, we are uncertain about the content of the element) and a <att>degree</att> attribute of "low" (that is, our degree of certainty is low). No other values may be used for these two attributes, and the <att>certainty</att> element must be an empty element that follows the title (i.e., it must not contain the title). For example:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<title>Разказ за пророк Самуил<certainty locus="value" degree="low"/>
</title>
</egXML>
<p>More generally (that is, not only with respect to scientific titles), question marks are never to be used to represent low certainty. The only correct way to represent low certainty is by including <code>&lt;certainty locus="value" degree="low"&gt;</code> inside the uncertain element, e.g.:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<name>Nikifor from Rila Monastery<certainty locus="value" degree="low"></certainty>
</name>
</egXML>
</div>
<div>
<head>
<note place="inline">Added: </note>Damaged or otherwise unclear text</head>
<p>Damaged or otherwise unclear text in incipita, etc. in the early Repertorium files was sometimes represented incorrectly with pseudo-markup, by surrounding the text in square brackets, e.g., <quote xml:lang="cu">"п[салти]рь"</quote> (where the text can be read, although with difficulty) or <quote xml:lang="cu">"п[.....]рь"</quote> (where the encoder can discern or guess the number of letters, but cannot identify what they are intended to represent). The only correct way of encoding unclear or damaged text is with the <gi>gap</gi>,<gi>unclear</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi> elements, as described below. As with parentheses and slashes, square brackets are never to be used in incipita and other transcribed text, whether to represent unclear or damaged text or for other purposes. The only raw text that may appear in these transcription elements is text that occurs literally in the manuscript, and all editorial annotation must be represented with markup.</p>
<p>Text that is physically missing or entirely illegible must be encoded as an empty <gi>gap</gi> element, e.g.:
</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<explicit defective="false">и сь риданїемь вѣлико<seg rend="sup">м</seg> ѕело 
                     г҃лаше<gap/>

</egXML>
<p>
                  If the extent of the gap can be identified, it may be represented with the <att>quantity</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes. e.g.:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<gap quantity="6" unit="character"/>
</egXML>
<p>The <gi>gap</gi> element is also to be used where text has been <hi rend="italics">omitted deliberately</hi> during transcription, and in that case the <gi>gap</gi> element must be accompanied by a <att>resp</att> attribute that identifies the editor responsible for the deletion (<gi>gap</gi> elements without a <att>resp</att> attribute are assumed to represent physical lacunae in the manuscript). The <att>resp</att> attribute must be a pointer to an <att>xml:id</att> attribute in our <ref target="http://repertorium.obdurodon.org/participants.php">participant list</ref>, e.g.:
</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>Where the editor supplies text to restore a missing or completely illegible reading, the restored text must be tagged as <gi>supplied</gi>, e.g.:</p>

<p>Dates in the attributes <att>when</att>,<att>notBefore</att>, and <att>notAfter</att> must be in ISO format. This means that dates that consist of just a year must be expressed with exactly four digits (using a leading zero for years before 1000). Year plus month must be formatted as YYYY-MM. Month plus date (for example, in the church calendar) require two leading hyphens, i.e., --MM-DD. For more information see <ptr target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"/>
.</p>
<p>References to dates in the church calendar should be encoded as <code>date type="churchCal"</code>, and the <gi>date</gi> element should be a child of <gi>msItemStruct</gi> (that is, not wrapped in a <gi>note</gi> element). The following example is from MP408G.xml:</p>

<p>In the TEI approach there are two ways to structure a given text at a high level: numbered and unnumbered text divisions. The Repertorium uses only the latter
                  approach. In the description of manuscripts in the Repertorium project the element
<gi>div</gi> is used only in cases when an unknown or rare text or text variant is discovered

<note place="inline">Added: </note>Folio count</head>
<p>The folio count must be given inside supportDesc/extent/measure, and the <gi>measure</gi> element itself must contain nothing but digits (Arabic and Roman) and plus signs, e.g., "123", "iii+25+ii". No plain text is ever to go inside the <gi>measure</gi> element, and the number of folios or bifolios must be wrapped in <gi>measure</gi> and must not appear as plain text inside the <gi>extent</gi> element. The <gi>measure</gi> element must also contain a <gi>unit</gi> attribute, the value of which typically is "folia" (at present "bifolio" also occurs once in the corpus). For example:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<note place="inline">Added: </note>
<gi>locus</gi> element</head>
<p>Locations within a manuscript must be tagged with the <gi>locus</gi> element without attributes. Because TEI P5 does not support a <att>unit</att> attribute on the <gi>locus</gi> element, the unit ("f.", "ff.", "p.", or "pp.", followed by a period and a space) must be included inside the element content, e.g.,</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<locus>ff. 1r–24r</locus>
</egXML>
<p>Note that in the case of folios, the side (lower-case "r" or "v") or column (lower-case "a", "b", "c", or "d") must be given with the number. Where there is a range, the separator must be an en-dash (–), and not a hyphen (-).</p>

<p>Paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) may appear in various places in the description – essentially
                  anywhere where there is not enough data for a structured description or where such a
                  description is otherwise unnecessary or undesirable. A possible example might be paragraphs in the element <gi>condition</gi>, where different types of damage or loss could
                  be grouped together, as in this example from the description of Codex Suprasliensis:

The only mandatory element is the description of file (<gi>fileDesc</gi>),

                  The first part of the TEI file contains the <gi>titleStmt</gi> (i.e., title statement),
                     which unifies information about the document title (<gi>title</gi>) and creators . In this
                        example there are three types of creators: author, editor and the person who edited
                        the XML code. Each of these creators is identified by the value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head xml:id="publication_stmt">Information on document publication</head>
<p>The second type of information deals with the publication of the document. It
                  includes the name of the publisher, place and date of publishing, internal Repertorium
                  identifier and availability (available, restricted, etc.). A sample of such information
                  could look as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>
<note>New: </note> The <gi>availability</gi> element must have a <att>status</att> attribute (typically with the value "free"), and it must not have a <att>default</att> attribute. For the usage of this element for the manuscript descrption see also <ref target="#lost_mss">Lost or destroyed manuscripts</ref>.
</p>
<p>The Repertorium identifier is formed from the abbreviation RC, meaning Repertoium code, followed by an en dash, the first letters of the author’s (i.e., encoder’s)
                  name, and an abbreviation of the repository and shelfmark. When the manuscript has
                  a special name or is divided into several repositories, a unique name is used.
</p>
<p>The content of the works in the Repertorium are published under a <ref target="http://creativecommons.org /licenses/by-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons license</ref> that allows users to share (to copy, distribute and transmit the work)
                  under the condition that they must attribute the work in appropriate way and may not
                  alter, transform, or build upon it. This

</div>
<div>
<head>The source of the document</head>
<p>The last part of the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element deals with sources. In the case of a manu-
                  script description that is intended to serve as the sole content of the electronic file, this
                  information may be very brief. A thorough explanation of the sources for the description
                  could then be part of the <gi>recordHist</gi> element in the administrative part of the file
                     (<gi>adminInfo</gi> ). A short example of a bibliographic reference could be:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<sourceDesc>
<p>
<ref type="edition" target="../bibliography/zbib.xml#ZaimovJ_CapaldoM1982">
                        Заимов, Капалдо 1982</ref>
</p>
</sourceDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>If, however, the description is to be accompanied by an edition of the manuscript
                  text, then the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> should contain all elements of the description, begin-
                     ning with the <gi>msDesc</gi>. In that case the edited text of the manuscript would consti-
                        tute the body of the document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  Most of the files in the Repertorium are in Bulgarian, English and Old Bulgarian (Old
                  Slavic, Old Church Slavonic). Latin is also used widely, especially in some manuscript
                  names, e.g., <emph>Codex Zographensis</emph>. In this place in the description it is encoded as:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>The Repertorium uses its own metadata scheme for metadata, encoded with
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     The metadata itself is always represented

<head>Descriptions of possible document changes</head>
<p>Changes or revisions are recorded as part of the element <gi>revisionDesc</gi>.
                  Each change is documented separately, starting with the most recent, e.g.:

                  elsewhere. The date in the attribute is in year-month-day format. This list of revisions
                  is intended to reflect primarily the technical side of the document. The documentation
                  of editorial changes of a manuscript description might more properly be encoded in the
<gi>recordHist</gi> as part of the administrative information (<gi>adminInfo</gi>).
</p>

<div>
<head>Romanization</head>
<p>Romanization (the transliteration of Cyrillic into Latin characters) follows the "international scientific" system, documented at <ref target="http://repertorium.obdurodon.org/transliteration.xhtml">Romanization (transliteration of Cyrillic into Latin characters)</ref> (mirrored from <ptr target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_transliteration_of_Cyrillic"/>
).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>Superscription</head>
<p>Superscription in the early Repertorium files was encoded in at least four different ways, two using markup (the <gi>c</gi> and <gi>seg</gi> elements) and two using pseudo-markup (surrounding the superscript character with slashes or parentheses, e.g., "е/с/" or "е(с)" for ес. The only correct way of encoding superscription is with &lt;seg rend="sup"&gt;, e.g., as "е&lt;seg rend="sup"&gt;с&lt;/seg&gt;". That is, use <gi>seg</gi>, and not <gi>c</gi>, to mark up a superscript character. Parentheses and slashes are never to be used in incipita and other transcribed text, whether to represent superscription or for other purposes. The only raw text that can appear in these transcription elements is text that occurs literally in the manuscript, and all editorial annotation must be represented with markup.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>Types of Books</head>
<p>Use the terms in bold below to represent the types of books described beside them. We follow the usage of the<hi rend="italics"> Oxford dictionary of Byzantium</hi> where possible, which, among other things, means that we favor Greek spellings (e.g., Praxapostol<hi rend="italics">os</hi>) over Latinized ones (Praxapostol<hi rend="italics">us</hi>).
</p>
<list>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Gospel book</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">tetraevangelion</hi>
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Lectionary</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">aprakos gospel</hi>
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">Praxapostolos</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">lectionary Acts and Epistles</hi>
</item>
</list>
</div>
<div>
<head>When should a holy person be labeled as a saint?</head>
<p>Holy persons are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> labeled as saints when their names appear as authors of texts. For example, the authoritative title for Clement of Ohrid’s "Sermon before receiving holy communion" is "Поучение преди причастие от Климент Охридски" (not "… от св. Климент …").</p>
<p>Holy persons <hi rend="italics">are</hi> labeled as saints when they appear otherwise than as authors. For example, the authoritative title of the "Akathist hymn in honor of St. John the Baptist" is "Акатист за св. Йоан Кръстител" (not "Акатист за Йоан …", without the "св."). The only exception is that the word "Богородица" is never preceded by "св.".</p>
<p>The label for a saint is never repeated in texts dedicated to multiple saints. For example, "Служба за св. Пров, Тарах и Андроник и Козма Маюмски" uses "св." just once, before the first saint mentioned, and does not repeat it.</p>
<p>Where possible, we follow the <hi rend="italics">Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium</hi> for names of persons, so "Gregory of Nazianzos" rather than "Gregory the Theologian". The Apostles are referred to as "St. Paul the Apostle". "Pseudo" names put the "pseudo" last in parentheses, so "Basil the Great (Pseudo)".</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>Conclusion</head>
<p>The Repertorium Initiative provides detailed, structured additions to the TEI XML manuscript description model. It complements the TEI model in some parts through the rearrangement of known elements, the addition of new ones, and the extension of the base of specialized
               attributes, all with an eye toward intra-project consistency and support for particular details of
               the Slavonic philological tradition.
